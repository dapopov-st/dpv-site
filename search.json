Recent advances in the theory of comparative statics are used to derive the basic comparative statics of the model, which are contained in an observable negative semi-definite matrix and possess the form of Slutsky-like expressions. We consider several command-and-control pollution constraints that are commonly implemented in practice, and conclude that the intrinsic comparative statics properties of the model are qualitatively invariant to the type of command-and-control pollution constraint imposed. We compare our results with those extant, and find that several basic results from the standard A–J model no longer hold in our model.\nPublication link"

    "title": "Part 1 - Building GPT-2 Architecture",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The following project/write-up arises from my interest in understanding the under-the-hood details of training transformers. I’ve studied Andrej Karphaty’s video “Let’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.” when it came out in 2023, and started working on describing parts he didn’t yet explain. Then “Let’s reproduce GPT-2 (124M)” came out, which answered a lot of my questions and compelled me to finish up the write up and make it available to others. My hope is that it will serve as a good review to those studying Andrej’s work, or those who do not have time to carefully work through a 4H+ video (which is highly, highly recommended).\n\nPart 1 focuses on building the transformer, Part 2 on optimizing it, and in the parts that follow, I hope to describe my own tokenization and training experiments.\n\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nimport math\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll be implementing the right hand side (the decoder) that composes GPT-2: each unit on the right will be a block in our transformer.\n\n\n\n\nTransformer Architecture from “Attention Is All You Need” by Vaswani et al.\n\n\n\nThe configuration below is the configuration for the entire tranformer, with each layer h pertaining to one of the blocks. We want to replicate the following structure from a GPT-2 model in Huggingface Transformers:\n\n\n\n\nSource: HF Transformer, image by the author\n\n\n\nThe code below is the skeleton on GPT2 config and main module that will allow us to replicate that structure:\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass GPTConfig:\n    block_size: int = 256\n    vocab_size: int = 65\n    n_layer: int = 6\n    n_head: int = 8\n    n_embd: int = 384\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.config = config\n        # With nn.ModuleDict() index into submodules just like a dictionary\n        self.tranformer = nn.ModuleDict(dict(\n            wte = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.n_embd),\n            wpe = nn.Embedding(config.block_size, config.n_embd),\n            h = nn.ModuleList([Block(config) for _ in range(config.n_layer)]),\n            ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)\n            )\n        )\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.vocab_size, bias=False)\n\n\nnn.ModuleDict allows you to index into submodules using keys, just like a dictionary.\nnn.ModuleList allows us to index into each individual layer using an index, just like with a list\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s implement the Block,…\nUnlike the original GPT2 paper, establish a clean residual pathway by taking the layer norm of x and applying attention/multilayer perceptron layer to it then adding it to the input x. Since addition allows for an adulterated gradient flow during backpropagation, this pre-layer norm configuration is the better than the post-layer norm configuration where the norm is applied after the addition. More formally, Xiong et al. (2020) have shown that if post-layer norm is used, a warm-up stage is needed to avoid training instability whereas if pre-layer norm is used, the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. See the difference between original (Post-LN) GPT-2 implementation and the ‘corrected’ pre-LN implementation used here:\n\n\n\n\nSource: “On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture” by Xiong et al. 2020\n\n\n\nFinally, onto the Block:\n\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.config = config    \n        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)\n        self.attn = CausalSelfAttention(config)\n        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)\n        self.mlp = MLP(config)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\n\n\nNote again how the layer norm is applied before the addition to the residual stream.\nAndrej notes that attention is a communication operation, where tokens communicate with each other and aggregate information. Thus attention can be thought of as a pooling function/weighted sum function/reduce operation. On the other hand, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is applied to each token individually, with no information exchanged between the tokens. Thus attention is a reduce and MLP is the map operation and a transformer is a repeated application of MapReduce.\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly summarizing from Andrej’s previous video (Let’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.), multilayer perceptron is implemented using a standard “bottleneck architecture” where the dimensions are first expanded to learn more complex representations, nonlinearity is applied to help the model learn more complex patterns, and finally the data is projected down again to keep the computational complexity in check.\n\n\nclass MLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.c_fc = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd*4)\n        self.gelu = nn.GELU(approximate='tanh')\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(config.n_embd*4, config.n_embd)\n    def forward(self,x):\n        x = self.c_fc(x)\n        x = self.gelu(x)\n        x = self.c_proj(x)\n        return x    \n\n\nGPT-2 used an approximate version of GeLU because at the time of GPT-2’s creation, the erf function was very slow in TensorFlow and GPT-2 and the approximate version was used. Today there’s no reason to use the approximate version but Andrej is using the tanh approximation for veracity.\n\nAlso, GeLU is better than ReLU due to dead neuron problem since a local gradient is always present as seen below:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej’s attention implementation is a more efficient implementation of the following simple one from “Lets build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out”:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/blob/master/gpt.py\n\n\n\nNotice how in the implemenation above it is clear that the heads are parallel streams whose outputs are concatenated.\nThe idea of the more efficient implementation is to make another batch dimension with nh so that PyTorch effectively makes batches of dimension (B,nh) and applies all the operations on both B and nh in parallel.\n\nEach token emits query, key, and value. Queries and keys first multiply each other to deterimine “how interesting they find each other”.\n\nNext, we apply an autoregressive mask to make sure the tokens only attend to tokens before them.\n\nThe softmax normalizes the attention so it sums to 1.\nThe matrix multiply of attention with the values is a way, at every single token, to do a weigthed sum of the tokens each token finds intersting.\n\nTranspose, contiguous, and view reassembles everything in memory and performs what is equivalent of a concatenation operation.\n\ny.transpose(1,2): This line swaps the second and third dimensions of y. So the shape of y changes from (B, nh, T, hs) to (B, T, nh, hs).\n.contiguous(): This is used to ensure that the tensor is stored in a contiguous block of memory, which is required for some operations in PyTorch, including view.\n.view(B, T, C): This line reshapes the tensor y to have dimensions (B, T, C). Here, C is equal to nh*hs, which means that the last two dimensions of y (nh and hs) are flattened into a single dimension. This effectively concatenates the outputs of all the attention heads side by side.\n\nFinally, the output projection doesn’t change the dimension of y, but does introduce another learnable transformation so that the output can be projected in a way that is most useful for downstream tasks.\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__()\n        assert config.n_embd % config.n_head == 0\n        #key, qury, value projections for all heads in a batch\n        self.c_attn = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd*3)\n        # output projection\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd)\n        \n        self.n_head = config.n_head\n        self.n_embd = config.n_embd\n        # mask to prevent attention to future tokens\n        self.register_buffer(\"bias\", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size))\n                             .view(1, 1, config.block_size, config.block_size)) # becomes available as self.bias\n    def forward(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.size()\n        # calculate query, key, value for all heads in batch\n        qkv = self.c_attn(x) # (B,T, self.n_embd) x (self.n_embd,self.n_embd*3) = (B,T,self.n_embd*3)\n        q, k, v  = qkv.split(self.n_embd, dim=2) # (B,T,self.n_embd) x 3; make each split size self.n_embd by splitting dim 2\n        q = q.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2) # (B, nh, T, hs)\n        k = k.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        # attention materializes a large (T,T) matrix fo each query and key\n        att = (q @ k.transpose(-2,-1))*(1.0/math.sqrt(k.size(-1))) # (B, nh, T, hs) x (B, nh, hs, T) = (B, nh, T, T)\n        att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))\n        att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)\n        y = att @ v # (B, nh, T, T) x (B, nh, T, hs) = (B, nh, T, hs)\n        # Change (B, nh, T, hs) to (B, T, nh, hs) with transpose, reassemle in memory, (B,T,C) makes nh*hs = n_embd (C)\n        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) \n        # output projection: additional learnable transformation\n        y = self.c_proj(y) # (B, T, C)@(C, C) = (B, T, C)\n        return y\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore the attention mask buffers (these are not parameters)\nThe weights in Hugging Face version are transposed (as they are in the original TensorFlow implementation) from what PyTorch needs because they use Conv1D module. Since we want to use plan nn.Linear, we hardcode these and transpose them.\n\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    @classmethod\n    def from_pretrained(cls, model_type):\n        \"\"\"Loads pretrained GPT-2 model weights from huggingface\"\"\"\n        assert model_type in {'gpt2', 'gpt2-medium', 'gpt2-large', 'gpt2-xl'}\n        from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel\n        print(\"loading weights from pretrained gpt: %s\" % model_type)\n\n        # n_layer, n_head and n_embd are determined from model_type\n        config_args = {\n            'gpt2':         dict(n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768),  # 124M params\n            'gpt2-medium':  dict(n_layer=24, n_head=16, n_embd=1024), # 350M params\n            'gpt2-large':   dict(n_layer=36, n_head=20, n_embd=1280), # 774M params\n            'gpt2-xl':      dict(n_layer=48, n_head=25, n_embd=1600), # 1558M params\n        }[model_type]\n        config_args['vocab_size'] = 50257 # always 50257 for GPT model checkpoints\n        config_args['block_size'] = 1024 # always 1024 for GPT model checkpoints\n        # create a from-scratch initialized minGPT model\n        config = GPTConfig(**config_args)\n        model = GPT(config)\n        sd = model.state_dict()\n        sd_keys = sd.keys()\n        sd_keys = [k for k in sd_keys if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')] # discard this mask / buffer, not a param\n\n        # init a huggingface/transformers model\n        model_hf = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_type) # HF GPT2LMHeadModel has .from_pretrained method, just like ours\n        sd_hf = model_hf.state_dict()\n\n        # copy while ensuring all of the parameters are aligned and match in names and shapes\n        sd_keys_hf = sd_hf.keys()\n        sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.masked_bias')] # ignore these, just a buffer\n        sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')] # same, just the mask (buffer)\n        transposed = ['attn.c_attn.weight', 'attn.c_proj.weight', 'mlp.c_fc.weight', 'mlp.c_proj.weight']\n        # basically the openai checkpoints use a \"Conv1D\" module, but we only want to use a vanilla Linear\n        # this means that we have to transpose these weights when we import them\n        assert len(sd_keys_hf) == len(sd_keys), f\"mismatched keys: {len(sd_keys_hf)} != {len(sd_keys)}\"\n        for k in sd_keys_hf:\n            if any(k.endswith(w) for w in transposed):\n                # special treatment for the Conv1D weights we need to transpose\n                assert sd_hf[k].shape[::-1] == sd[k].shape\n                with torch.no_grad():\n                    sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k].t())\n            else:\n                # vanilla copy over the other parameters\n                assert sd_hf[k].shape == sd[k].shape\n                with torch.no_grad():\n                    sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k])\n\n        return model\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nn.Embedding layer in PyTorch takes an input tensor of arbitrary shape with values in the range [0, vocab_size) and maps each integer in that range to a dense vector of size C (the embedding dimension). In our case, we have an input tensor idx of shape (B, T), where B is the batch size and T is the sequence length, then applying the embedding layer to idx will yield a tensor of shape (B, T, C). This is because each integer in idx is replaced with its corresponding embedding vector. Since the embedding vectors have C elements, this adds an extra dimension of size C to the output. So for every batch and every sequence position, an embedding of size C is constructed, resulting in an output of shape (B, T, C).\nAlso note that the position embedding is broadcast to the token embedding and the same position embedding vector is learned at (T,C) for every element in B. This works because the position embeddings are independent of the specific sequence it’s in, so it can be shared across all sequences in the batch.\n\n\nclass GPT2(nn.Module):\n    ...    \n    def forward(self, idx):\n        # input indices are always of shape (B, T) where B is batch size and T is block size\n        B, T = idx.size()\n        assert T &lt;= self.config.block_size, \"Cannot forward, model block size is exhausted.\"\n        # forward the token and position embeddings\n        pos = torch.arange(0, T , dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device) # shape (T,)\n        tok_emb = self.transformer.wte(idx) # (B,T)-&gt; (B, T, C)\n        pos_emb = self.transformer.wpe(pos) # (T,)-&gt;     (T, C) \n        x = tok_emb + pos_emb               # (B, T, C) + (T, C) -&gt; (B, T, C) via broadcasting\n        # forward the blocks of the transformer\n        for block in self.transformer.h:\n            x = block(x)\n        # forward the final layer norm and the classifier head\n        x = self.transformer.ln_f(x)\n        logits = self.lm_head(x) # shape (B, T, vocab_size)\n        return logits\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to get close to generations from the Hugging Face pipeline:\n\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline, set_seed\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\nset_seed(42)\ngenerator(\"Hello, I'm a language model,\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n\nTo generate next token predictions, get the next top 50 tokens so that the model does not deviate too much from likely tokens, and sample one token from this distribution.\nConcatenate the token obtained from sampling with input (or input plus previously sampled tokens) at each step.\nThe sampling will not match the Hugging Face generations exactly since there’s likely a parameter hiding in the pipeline that’s different, but will be sensible English.\n\n\nnum_return_sequences = 5\nmax_length = 30\nmodel = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel.eval()\nmodel.to('cuda')\n\n# prefix tokens\nimport tiktoken\nenc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')\ntokens = enc.encode(\"Hello I'm a language model, \")\nx = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long).unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences,1).to('cuda') # (5,8) since sent. tokenized to 8 tokens\n\n# generate: with each loop iteration, generate one more token\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\ntorch.cuda.manual_seed(42)\nwhile x.size(1) &lt; max_length:\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        logits = model(x) # (B,T,vocab_size)\n        logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # take the logits at the last position\n        probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1) # get the probabilities\n        topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, 50, dim=-1) # get the top-50 tokens\n        ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, num_samples=1) # sample from the top 50\n        xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix) # select the indices of the sampled tokens\n        x = torch.cat((x, xcol), dim=1) # append the sampled token to the sequence\n\nfor i in range(num_return_sequences):\n    tokens = x[i,:max_length].tolist()\n    decoded = enc.decode(tokens)\n    print('&gt;',decoded)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, simply replace the GPT model initialization as below:\n\n\n#model = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect the most powerful device available and use it\n\n\ndevice = 'cpu'\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    device = 'cuda'\n    print(\"using GPU\")\nelif hasattr(torch.backends, 'mps') and torch.backends.mps.is_available():\n    device = 'mps'\n    print(\"using MPS\")\n\n\nNote that we guarded against device mismatch by initializing pos on the correct device.\n\n\npos = torch.arange(0, T , dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device) # shape (T,)\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej’s favorite debugging dataset is Tiny Shakespeare which can be loaded and previewed as below:\n\n\n#!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt\nwith open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    text = f.read()\ndata = text[:1000]\nprint(data[:100])\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou\n\n\n\nTo get the corresponding GPT-2 tokens, load the tokenizer via tiktoken’s get_encoding method and encode the text data.\n\n\nimport tiktoken\nenc = tiktoken.get_encoding(\"gpt2\")\ntokens = enc.encode(data)\nprint(tokens[:24])\n\n[5962, 22307, 25, 198, 8421, 356, 5120, 597, 2252, 11, 3285, 502, 2740, 13, 198, 198, 3237, 25, 198, 5248, 461, 11, 2740, 13]\n\n\n\nAndrej’s favorite way to create a batch is to use view, which returns a new tensor with same data but different shape. It’s a view because the returned tensor shares the same underlying data with the original tensor and a change in one will affect the other.\nSince the desired outputs for every token in the (B,T) batch are just to the right of that token, extend the buffer by one element, take all but the last token as inputs and the first token onwards as outputs:\n\n\nimport torch\nbuf = torch.tensor(tokens[:24+1])\nx = buf[:-1].view(4,6)\ny = buf[1:].view(4,6)\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n\ntensor([[ 5962, 22307,    25,   198,  8421,   356],\n        [ 5120,   597,  2252,    11,  3285,   502],\n        [ 2740,    13,   198,   198,  3237,    25],\n        [  198,  5248,   461,    11,  2740,    13]])\ntensor([[22307,    25,   198,  8421,   356,  5120],\n        [  597,  2252,    11,  3285,   502,  2740],\n        [   13,   198,   198,  3237,    25,   198],\n        [ 5248,   461,    11,  2740,    13,   198]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPass in the optional targets and calculate cross entropy loss.

Thus we expect loss to be around -ln(1/50257) = 10.82. Currently, the loss starts around this value, which is a good sanity check.\nAlso, we can make sure that the training is set up correctly by overfitting on a single batch. Running the training loop for 500 iterations on the same batch yields: iteration 499, loss = 0.0008159472490660846\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a simple data loader, advance by batches of size BT, set the input x* and output y as before, and loop around to the start of our tokens if run out of them:\n\n\nclass DataLoaderLite:\n    def __init__(self, B, T):\n        self.B = B\n        self.T = T\n        # load the data from disk into memory\n        with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n            text = f.read()\n        enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')\n        self.tokens = torch.tensor(enc.encode(text))\n        print(f\"total tokens: {len(self.tokens)}\")\n        print(f\"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens)//(B*T)} batches\")\n    \n        self.current_position = 0\n    \n    def next_batch(self):\n        B, T = self.B, self.T\n        buf = self.tokens[self.current_position:self.current_position+B*T+1]\n        x = (buf[:-1]).view(B,T)\n        y = (buf[1:]).view(B,T)\n        self.current_position += B*T\n        # if run out of tokens, loop around to zero\n        if self.current_position + B*T &gt;= len(self.tokens):\n            self.current_position = 0\n        return x, y\n\n\nUsing this data loader, loading and training can now be done concisely as below:\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=4,T=32)\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\nmodel.to(device)\n# create an optimizer object\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    print(f'iteration {i}, loss = {loss.item()}')\n    \n\n\nNote that even with different batches of text loaded at every step, the loss still goes down quickly because many of the tokens will not occur in out data set and GPT2 can, for example, drive down the biases (mask) of all the logits that don’t occur in our data to negative infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that transformer.wte.weight and lm_head.weight are of the same shape (50257*768).\nIn addition, we can below that these point to the same tensor.\n\n\n(sd_hf['lm_head.weight']==sd_hf['transformer.wte.weight']).all() # tensor(True)\nsd_hf['lm_head.weight'].data_ptr()==sd_hf['transformer.wte.weight'].data_ptr()\n\n\nThis weight tying scheme comes from p.5 of Attention is All You Need paper, which in turn used the work of Press and Wolf (2017). The idea is that if two tokens are very similar semantically, they should be close in the token embedding space. For the same reason, we expect these tokens to have similar probabilities in the output of a transformer. Press and Wolf (2017) argue that tying these weights leads to better performance. The weight scheme can be implemented in code as\n\n\nself.transformer.wte.weight = self.lm_head.weight\n\n\nNote that this weight sharing scheme also entails a significant memory savings of 38,597,376 parameters (768*50257) for the 124M model, which amounts to about 30% of the weights.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI initialized the weights with mean 0 and standard deviation with 0.02 and the bias with 0. They initialized the token embeddings with mean 0 and standard deviation with 0.02 and position embeddings with 0.01.\nFollowing Xavier initialization, the standard deviation should be 1/sqrt(in_features_for_layer), and with 768 to 1600 features used by GPT-2 models of different sizes, 0.02 is approximately correct. Ideally, though, one would want the standard deviation to scale down more precisely with the model size.\nIn code, this leads to\n\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    def _init_weights(self, module):\n        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n            if module.bias is not None:\n                torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std = 0.02)\n    \n\n\nIn addition, observe that our Block’s forward method contains a residual stream:\n\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\n\n\nNot accounting for this in initialization would lead to exploding variance as seen from the following simple example:\n\n\nx = torch.zeros(768)\nn = 100\nfor _ in range(n):\n    x += torch.randn(768)\nprint(x.std())\n\ntensor(10.0776)\n\n\n\nHowever, scaling it by 1/sqrt(N) approximately yields the original standard deviation of 1 as seen below:\n\n\nx = torch.zeros(768)\nn = 100\nfor _ in range(n):\n    x += n**-.5*torch.randn(768)\nprint(x.std())\n\ntensor(0.9894)\n\n\n\nTo implement it in our transformer, add flags in the attention and mlp modules since these have residual connections:\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        ...\n        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1\n        ...\nclass MLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        ...\n        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1\n     \n\n\nThen in the GPT module, check if a module has this attribute and adjust the standard deviation accordingly. Note that 2 multiplies self.config.n_layers because the residual connection is used twice: once for attention and once for the mlp module.\n\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    ...\n\n    def _init_weights(self, module):\n        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):\n            std = 0.02\n            if hasattr(module, \"NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT\"):\n                # number of residual layers is double self.config.n_layers\n                # one for attention, one for mlp\n                std *= (2*self.config.n_layers)**-0.5\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std) \n            if module.bias is not None:\n                torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\nPress, O., & Wolf, L.

    "text": "Now let’s implement the Block,…\nUnlike the original GPT2 paper, establish a clean residual pathway by taking the layer norm of x and applying attention/multilayer perceptron layer to it then adding it to the input x. Since addition allows for an adulterated gradient flow during backpropagation, this pre-layer norm configuration is the better than the post-layer norm configuration where the norm is applied after the addition. More formally, Xiong et al. (2020) have shown that if post-layer norm is used, a warm-up stage is needed to avoid training instability whereas if pre-layer norm is used, the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. See the difference between original (Post-LN) GPT-2 implementation and the ‘corrected’ pre-LN implementation used here:\n\n\n\n\nSource: “On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture” by Xiong et al. 2020\n\n\n\nFinally, onto the Block:\n\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.config = config    \n        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)\n        self.attn = CausalSelfAttention(config)\n        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)\n        self.mlp = MLP(config)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\n\n\nNote again how the layer norm is applied before the addition to the residual stream.\nAndrej notes that attention is a communication operation, where tokens communicate with each other and aggregate information. Thus attention can be thought of as a pooling function/weighted sum function/reduce operation. On the other hand, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is applied to each token individually, with no information exchanged between the tokens. Thus attention is a reduce and MLP is the map operation and a transformer is a repeated application of MapReduce."

So the shape of y changes from (B, nh, T, hs) to (B, T, nh, hs).\n.contiguous(): This is used to ensure that the tensor is stored in a contiguous block of memory, which is required for some operations in PyTorch, including view.\n.view(B, T, C): This line reshapes the tensor y to have dimensions (B, T, C). Here, C is equal to nh*hs, which means that the last two dimensions of y (nh and hs) are flattened into a single dimension. This effectively concatenates the outputs of all the attention heads side by side.\n\nFinally, the output projection doesn’t change the dimension of y, but does introduce another learnable transformation so that the output can be projected in a way that is most useful for downstream tasks.\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__()\n        assert config.n_embd % config.n_head == 0\n        #key, qury, value projections for all heads in a batch\n        self.c_attn = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd*3)\n        # output projection\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd)\n        \n        self.n_head = config.n_head\n        self.n_embd = config.n_embd\n        # mask to prevent attention to future tokens\n        self.register_buffer(\"bias\", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size))\n                             .view(1, 1, config.block_size, config.block_size)) # becomes available as self.bias\n    def forward(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.size()\n        # calculate query, key, value for all heads in batch\n        qkv = self.c_attn(x) # (B,T, self.n_embd) x (self.n_embd,self.n_embd*3) = (B,T,self.n_embd*3)\n        q, k, v  = qkv.split(self.n_embd, dim=2) # (B,T,self.n_embd) x 3; make each split size self.n_embd by splitting dim 2\n        q = q.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2) # (B, nh, T, hs)\n        k = k.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        # attention materializes a large (T,T) matrix fo each query and key\n        att = (q @ k.transpose(-2,-1))*(1.0/math.sqrt(k.size(-1))) # (B, nh, T, hs) x (B, nh, hs, T) = (B, nh, T, T)\n        att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))\n        att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)\n        y = att @ v # (B, nh, T, T) x (B, nh, T, hs) = (B, nh, T, hs)\n        # Change (B, nh, T, hs) to (B, T, nh, hs) with transpose, reassemle in memory, (B,T,C) makes nh*hs = n_embd (C)\n        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) \n        # output projection: additional learnable transformation\n        y = self.c_proj(y) # (B, T, C)@(C, C) = (B, T, C)\n        return y"

In our case, we have an input tensor idx of shape (B, T), where B is the batch size and T is the sequence length, then applying the embedding layer to idx will yield a tensor of shape (B, T, C). This is because each integer in idx is replaced with its corresponding embedding vector. Since the embedding vectors have C elements, this adds an extra dimension of size C to the output. So for every batch and every sequence position, an embedding of size C is constructed, resulting in an output of shape (B, T, C).\nAlso note that the position embedding is broadcast to the token embedding and the same position embedding vector is learned at (T,C) for every element in B.

    "text": "OpenAI initialized the weights with mean 0 and standard deviation with 0.02 and the bias with 0. They initialized the token embeddings with mean 0 and standard deviation with 0.02 and position embeddings with 0.01.\nFollowing Xavier initialization, the standard deviation should be 1/sqrt(in_features_for_layer), and with 768 to 1600 features used by GPT-2 models of different sizes, 0.02 is approximately correct. Ideally, though, one would want the standard deviation to scale down more precisely with the model size.\nIn code, this leads to\n\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    def _init_weights(self, module):\n        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n            if module.bias is not None:\n                torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):\n            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std = 0.02)\n    \n\n\nIn addition, observe that our Block’s forward method contains a residual stream:\n\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\n\n\nNot accounting for this in initialization would lead to exploding variance as seen from the following simple example:\n\n\nx = torch.zeros(768)\nn = 100\nfor _ in range(n):\n    x += torch.randn(768)\nprint(x.std())\n\ntensor(10.0776)\n\n\n\nHowever, scaling it by 1/sqrt(N) approximately yields the original standard deviation of 1 as seen below:\n\n\nx = torch.zeros(768)\nn = 100\nfor _ in range(n):\n    x += n**-.5*torch.randn(768)\nprint(x.std())\n\ntensor(0.9894)\n\n\n\nTo implement it in our transformer, add flags in the attention and mlp modules since these have residual connections:\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        ...\n        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1\n        ...\nclass MLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self,config):\n        ...\n        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1\n     \n\n\nThen in the GPT module, check if a module has this attribute and adjust the standard deviation accordingly.

    "text": "The following is Part 2 of my extended write-up on building and training GPT-2 from scratch following along with “Let’s reproduce GPT-2 (124M)” by Karpathy. In this part, I discuss the optimizations that speed up training first on one, then multiple GPUs, also adding more detail where I felt necessary for my own understanding (hoping this will be helpful to others).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: GPU utilization on a 3090 with batch size of 10, image by the author\n\n\n\nEach iteration would take about 720ms with batch size of 10 on a 3090 (vs 1000 on A100 with double the batch size!), so I expect my single-GPU training to be a bit slower than Andrej’s. With Andrej’s A100, it’s possible to process one epoch in 20 batches of size 16 with about 1000ms/batch, whereas with a 3090, it’s possible to process one epoch in 33 batches of size 10 with 730ms/batch, so about 20% slower than Andrej’s time (33x730/20x1000).\nAlso, Andrej suggests using nice numbers that have lots of multiples of 2. I tried a batch size of 8, but in this specific use case, I found that using batch size of 10 vs 8 is slightly faster per epoch on a 3090.\nAlso, to properly time the code, it’s important to wait until the GPU processes a batch before the CPU times the work. It’s possible that the CPU has loaded a batch onto GPU, GPU is still processing it, and the CPU has moved on to record the end time for the operation. To prevent this from happening, use torch.cuda.synchronize():\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=10,T=1024)\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\nmodel.to(device)\n# create an optimizer object\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    #import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize() # wait for GPU to finish all the scheduled work\n    t1= time.time()\n    dt = (t1-t0)*1000 # time diff in seconds\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T)/(t1-t0)\n    print(f'iteration {i}, loss = {loss.item()}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nWe may change the batch size, so to get a more objective measure of training speed, look at tokens/second, which is 16.3K on an A100 and 14.1K on a 3090.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst observe that we can check the type of the logits in our model by starting an interactive debugging session as below:\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=4,T=32)\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\nmodel.to(device)\n# create an optimizer object\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    print(f'iteration {i}, loss = {loss.item()}')\n    \n\n\nWhich yields\n\n\n(InteractiveConsole)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; logits.dtype\ntorch.float32\n\n\nPyTorch supports up to FP64 precision, which is useful for scientific computing applications, but deep learning training can tolerate significantly lower precision than default FP32, however.\nFrom A100 spec sheet, for example, it’s possible to get 16x performance improvement by going down from FP32 to FP16 Tensor Core.\nFor deep learning, sparsity feature is not currently used, so disregard the second number in a cell when it’s present.\nWe do not use INT8 for training since it implies a uniform distribution and we need a normal distribution provided by the float data types. INT8 is used for inference, however.\nThe memory bandwidth of an A100 is 1935GB/s, and most well-tuned application are bound more by memory than by speed. Lowering precision means tensors will take less space in memory, making it easier to satisfy the memory bandwidth constraint.\n\nTo summarize, by lowering precision, “we can store more and access it faster” (Andrej).\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/programming-tensor-cores-cuda-9/\n\n\n\nA Tensor Core is an instruction in a given architecture, in the case above for a 4x4 multiply and add operations. Any time we have multiply (and less importantly add) operations, which compose the majority of our GPT-2 transformer, these operations will be performed using Tensor Cores. For example, the classifier head matrix multiply going from 768 to 50257 dominates the computations in GPT-2.\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf\n\n\n\nWith FP32 (torch.float32 default of PyTorch), both the input operands and the intermediate add/multiplies that compose individual elements of the result matrix are done in FP32.\nWe could switch to TF32, however, which uses the full 32 bits of FP32 for accumulator but just 19 bits for input operands due to lower number of mantissa bits as seen below:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf\n\n\n\nWith TF32, we get an 8x speedup without needing to modify the code. The outputs will still be in FP32 as seen below. If our application can tolerate a little bit of imprecision, TF32 is a great option. In practice,the difference between FP32 and TF32 is almost imperceptible.\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf\n\n\n\nOn my 24GB 3090, I was able to use batch size of 8 (or 10 max) with sequence length of 1024 (Andrej got away with batch size of 16 on 40GB A100):\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable TF32 in PyTorch, change the float32 matmul precision from it’s default ‘highest’ to ‘high’ with torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(‘high’):\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=10,T=1024)\n\ntorch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')\n...\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n   ...\n\n\nOn an A100, throughput increases from 16.1K tokens/second to about 49K tokens/second, so about a 3X speedup.\nOn 3090, this leads to only about 40% speedup from 14.1K tokens/second baseline to 19.6K tokens/second.\n\nWhile TF32 in principle offers an 8X speedup on an A100 (I couldn’t find reliable official estimates for 3090 TF32 tensor), a lot of these workloads are memory bound. Thus although a matrix multiplication could potentially happen 8X faster with TF32 compared to FP32, the output numbers are still FP32, and these get moved around through the memory system at a speed that’s much slower than the GPU’s ability to perform the calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s review the following once again\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf\n\n\n\nTo address the memory bandwidth constraint, we can use Bfloat16 (BF16) to more aggressively crop the mantissa without changing the sign and exponent (range) of the number.\n\nOriginally, FP16 was used, but this number format has a reduced range, causing issues that were patched by gradient scalers and similar solutions that introduced additional state and complexity. BF16 addresses these problems by preserving the original range of number.\nAndrej recommends studying the torch.autocast portion of mixed precision documentation, which has a context manager torch.autocast. This context manager is recommended around forward pass and loss calculation of the model only.\nWe thus only need to add one line of code as below:\n\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    loss.backward()\n    ...\n\n\nUsing an interactive console breakpoint\n\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n\n    loss.backward()\n    ...\n\n\nWe see that logits.dtype is indeed torch.bfloat16. Our weights remain in FP32, however, as model.transformer.wte.weight.dtype is torch.float32. This implies a mixed precision: PyTorch is keeping certain weights in full precision while converting others to bfloat16. What gets converted at what point is not exactly clear, but the general guidelines are below:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html\n\n\n\nThus matrix multiplications, addition, etc. get converted while layer norms, softmax, etc. do not since they are less robust to precision changes.\nOn an A100, our previous benchmark is 50K tokens/second and it goes up to 55K tokens/second with bfloat16, about a 10% speedup.\nOn a 3090, our previous benchmark is 19.6K tokens/second and it goes up to 27.5K tokens/second with bfloat16, about a 40% speedup, suggesting that 3090 was perhaps more memory-bound than the A100.\n\n\n\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=10,T=1024)\n\ntorch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')\n\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\nmodel.to(device)\n# torch.compile only needs a single line\nmodel = torch.compile(model)\n\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n\n\nThe first iteration with torch.compile will typically be slower since PyTorch takes time to compile the code at the start.\nOn an A100 with batch size of 16, Andrej observed a 2.3x improvement from using torch.compile.\nOn a 3090 with batch size of 10, no improvement was seen during the first run (27.4 K tokens/second -&gt; 26.8K tokens/second). However, switching down to batch size of 8 yielded a significant increase the first time around. However, when I repeated the experiment, torch.compile ended up being faster with batch size of 10 again! This could have been due to graph breaks or kernel launch overhead.\n\nTaking the best runtime with torch.compile and batch size of 10, 27.4 K -&gt; 41.7 K tokens/second, or about 48% speedup over mixed precision benchmark.\n\n\n\n\nSource: initial training dynamics, image by the author\n\n\n\ntorch.compile does the following:\n\nTake out the Python interpreter from the forward pass and compile the neural net as a single object\nReduce GPU read/writes as demonstrated in the following example. Suppose we didn’t use torch.compile and instead of nn.GELU in our MLP, we used our own custom implementation below:\n\nclass TanhGELU(nn.Module):\ndef forward(self, x):\n    return 0.5 * x * (1.0 + torch.tanh(math.sqrt(2.0 / math.pi)*(x + 0.044715 * torch.pow(x, 3.0))))\n\nLooking at the following diagram, the input would first need to be placed from the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) onto the GPU for the torch.pow(x, 3.0) computation. Once the results are computed, they would be sent back to HBM. Next the computed result would be sent back to be multiplied by 0.044715 and so on. This would results many reads and writes to and from GPU and HBM, which are the bottleneck in many modern system.\nSince all the operations in the custom TanhGELU are element-wise operations, torch.compile can move the input to GPU and, for every single element, perform all the operations while the memory is on the GPU, then write back a single time. This is an example of kernel fusion, a major way in which torch.compile creates a speedup.\n\n\n\n\n\ngpu-cpu\n\n\n\nIn addition, when the data is moved to GPU for element-wise operations, it will need intermediate memory, a small amount of which is found on the GPU. Andrej points out that on the GPU chip itself, there is L2 cache. On the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that do the calculation, there’s L1 memory and registers. These use SRAM for fast access times and low power consumption vs transistors and capacitors implementation of HBM. Below is a typical diagram of memory and associated access speeds from Dao et al. (2022), Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\nmemory-hierarchy\n\n\n\nWith mixed precision and torch.compile optimizations, Andrej’s training on an A100 is about 3X faster than training on a 3090, with 125K tokens/second processed on an A100 and 41.5K tokens/second on a 3090.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attention operation is currently composed of the four lines of code highlighted below:\n\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        ...\n    def forward(self, x):\n        ...\n        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        # -----Start: attention operation-----\n        att = (q @ k.transpose(-2,-1))*(1.0/math.sqrt(k.size(-1))) # (B, nh, T, hs) x (B, nh, hs, T) = (B, nh, T, T)\n        att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))\n        att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)\n        y = att @ v # (B, nh, T, T) x (B, nh, T, hs) = (B, nh, T, hs)\n        # -----End: attention operation-----\n        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) \n        ...\n\n\nFlashAttention is a kernel fusion operation that torch.compile cannot find currently. This is because kernel fusion requires an algorithmic rewrite of how attention is currently implemented. While FlashAttention requires more FLOPs, it ends up being significantly faster because of its judicious use of the memory hierarchy, which leads to fewer read/writes between GPU and HBM.\n\nIn particular, the NxN attention matrix is never read from/written to HBM. It’s simple to perform the matrix multiplications in a streaming manner, but computing softmax this way is more of a challenge. The crux of the algorithmic rewrite is the online softmax trick, which incrementally computes the softmax without needing all the inputs as is customary for standard softmax normalization. The key insight is that the softmax function can be broken down into smaller chunks, computed independently on GPU, and then combined using a ‘softmax trick’ formula. This enables FlashAttention to process long sequences more efficiently, without having to materialize the entire attention matrix at once.\n\nIn more detail, from p.5 of Dao et al. (2022), the softmax trick uses intermediate m and l variables that combine the statistics from individual ‘attention submatrices’ to reconstruct the softmax for the entire attention matrix.\n\nWith FlashAttention in place, the four lines above become one line in the following code:\n\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        ...\n    def forward(self, x):\n        ...\n        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        # -----Start: attention operation-----\n        y = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q,k,v, is_causal=True)\n        # -----End: attention operation-----\n        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) \n        ...\n\n\nThe loss after 50 iterations is identical to what it was before since FlashAttention is exact attention, not an approximation, so identical operations are performed. However, on a 3090, with FlashAttention added, about 50K tokens/second can be processed compared 41.7K tokens/second with just mixed precision+torch.compile, hence about a 20% speedup. On an A100, Andrej obtained about a 27% improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re looking for the numbers in our transformer to have as many powers of two as possible since GPU kernels work best with these. In particular, vocab_size is 50257, which is not odd; one simple way to change this is to round it up to 50304, which divides by 128 (2**7). This adds ‘fake’ tokens and increases the amount of computation, yet by working better with the GPU, it would generally lead to a speedup in training.\nNote that the vocab_size appears in the embedding and the classifier layer, and the extra tokens added there would never be used. The weight sharing implies that the network has to learn that the logits associated with the extra added rows need to be driven to zero, which is similar to how it is already learning to drive down weights for tokens not encountered in our training set.\nOn an A100, 4% improvement was observed; on a 3090, the training speed increased from 50K tokens/second to about 53 tokens/second, so about a 6% increase.\nAndrej elaborates on the reason for the speedup. Many of the CUDA kernels use block tiles, which are usually ‘nice numbers’ with many powers of 6, so calculations are done in powers of 64 or 32, for example. When the desired calculation does not neatly fit into these block tiles, less efficient boundary kernels come in to do the last part at the second pass.\nOptimizations targeted at GPT-2 specifically follow next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea with gradient clipping is that it’s possible to get a particularly ‘unlucky’ batch during training, which would lead to high loss and gradient, leading to training instability (or ‘shock’, as Andrej puts it).\n\n\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nSource: training dynamics with grad norm clipping, image by the author\n\n\n\nNote that the norm is still high at the start of the training. Since the weights are randomly initialized, a lot of learning happens to (generally) drive down the biases of the output tokens. The norm then stabilizes to be around 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe learning rate scheduler used is cosine decay learning rate scheduler.\n\nThere is a linear warmup step as it’s beneficial to have a low learning rate at the start since the network is randomly initialized.\nAfter that, the cosine decay takes place and the learning rate is gradually reduced to 10% of its original value.\nTaking the values for warmup steps and maximum number of steps from the GPT-3 paper (GPT-2 was scarce on training details), we see the following graph of learning rates:\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nmax_lr = 6e-4\nmin_lr = max_lr * 0.1\nwarmup_steps = 375\nmax_steps = 2600\ndef get_lr(it):\n    # 1.) linear warmup for warmup_iters steps\n    if it &lt; warmup_steps:\n        return max_lr * (it+1)/warmup_steps\n    # 2.) if it &gt; lr_decay_iters, return min learning rate\n    if it &gt; max_steps:\n        return min_lr\n    # 3.) in between, use cosine decay down to min learning rate\n    decay_ratio = (it - warmup_steps)/(max_steps-warmup_steps)\n    assert 0&lt;=decay_ratio&lt;=1\n    coeff = 0.5*(1.0 + math.cos(math.pi * decay_ratio)) # coef starts at 1 and goes to 0\n    return min_lr + coeff * (max_lr-min_lr)\n\nits = np.arange(0,max_steps)\nget_lr_vectorized = np.vectorize(get_lr)\nlrs = get_lr_vectorized(its)\nplt.plot(its,lrs)\nplt.title('Cosine Learning Rate Decay')\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of tokens processed by GPT-2 in millions\")\n\nText(0.5, 0, 'Number of tokens processed by GPT-2 in millions')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose to express the x-axis in tokens rather than steps to reduce the focus on hardware-related configurations used to train GPT-2 (eg, batch size), but the shape would be identical.\n\nThe learning rate scheduling can be added to the training loop in the code below:\n\n\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor step in range(50):\n    ...\n    loss.backward()\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration\n    lr = get_lr(step)\n    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:\n        param_group['lr'] = lr\n    optimizer.step()\n    ...\n\n\nNote that as part of setting the learning rate, we need to iterate through the parameter groups (of which there’s only one) and set the ‘lr’ parameter to our learning rate. This is a bit clunky, but Andrej’s impression is that it’s the way to do this in PyTorch currently. An alternative would be to use an off-the-shelf learning rates scheduler from PyTorch, but that’s an additional abstraction, and get_lr is composed of only a few lines of highly readable code.\nAndrej points out that the choice of a learning rate scheduler is up to the user and determining the ‘best’ one is an active area or research.\nIn addition, Andrej skips the gradual batch size increase used by GPT-2 since it complicates the arithmetic of the number of tokens used at each step in the optimization and it’s not a major improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecaying weights prevents any weight from getting too large, forcing the network to distribute the work.\nInstead of iterating over all the parameter updates, the kernels (computations) used for the AdamW update can be fused into a single kernel in more recent versions of PyTorch.\n\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    ...\n    \n    def configure_optimizers(self, weight_decay, learning_rate, device_type):\n        # start with all of the candidate parameters that require grad\n        param_dict = {pn: p for pn,p in self.named_parameters()}\n        param_dict = {pn: p for pn,p in param_dict.items() if p.requires_grad}\n        # create optim groups: any 2D parameter weight decays, others don't:\n        # weight tensors in matmuls + embeddings will decay, biases and layernorms will not\n        decay_params = [p for n,p in param_dict.items() if p.dim()&gt;=2]\n        nodecay_params = [p for n,p in param_dict.items() if p.dim()&lt;2]\n        optim_groups = [\n            {'params': decay_params, 'weight_decay': weight_decay},\n            {'params': nodecay_params, 'weight_decay': 0.0}\n        ]\n        num_decay_params = sum(p.numel() for p in decay_params)\n        num_nodecay_params = sum(p.numel() for p in nodecay_params)\n        print(f\"num decay param tensors: {len(decay_params)} with {num_decay_params} parameters\")\n        print(f\"num non-decay param tensors: {len(nodecay_params)} with {num_nodecay_params} parameters\")\n\n        fused_available = 'fused' in inspect.signature(torch.optim.AdamW).parameters\n        use_fused = fused_available and device_type == 'cuda'\n        print(f'using fused AdamW: {use_fused}')\n        optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(optim_groups, lr = learning_rate, betas=(0.9, 0.95), eps = 1e-8, fused=use_fused)\n        return optimizer\n# In the training loop replace the optimizer below:\n#optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(50):\n    ...\n\n\nAmong the output, we will see num decay param tensors: 50 with 124354560 parameters, num non-decay param tensors: 98 with 121344 parameters. Hence most of the parameters will be weight decayed.\nOn an A100, Andrej observed about a 3% speedup due to the fused optimizer, while I saw about a 2% speedup on a 3090.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between weight decay, batch size, and learning rate is quite complex. In GPT-2, smaller batch size and bigger learning rate was likely used for smaller neural networks and larger batch size with smaller learning rate for larger ones. For the smallest network size, OpenAI used a batch size of 0.5M tokens. With 1024 tokens/batch, this implies a batch size of about 500. However, we would still like to use the effective batch size of 0.5M since it’s related to other hyperparameters determined by OpenAI. A solution to this is gradient accumulation, which allows us to simulate in a serial way any arbitrary batch size of our choice.\n\n\n# ----------------- Batch size -----------------\ntotal_batch_size = 524288 # 2**19 ~ 0.5M\nB = 8 # micro batch size on a 3090; switching down 10-&gt;8 since speeds are comparable and it factors evenly into total_batch_size above\nT = 1024\nassert total_batch_size % (B*T) == 0, 'make sure total_batch_size is divisible by B*T'\ngrad_accum_steps = total_batch_size//(B*T)\nprint(f\"total desired batch size: {total_batch_size}\")\nprint(f\"=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: {grad_accum_steps}\")\n\ntotal desired batch size: 524288\n=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: 64\n\n\n\nThus we’ll need to do 64 forward backward steps followed by a single gradient update. For context, our current training loop is\n\n\n\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        #import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n    loss.backward()\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration\n    lr = get_lr(step)\n    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:\n        param_group['lr'] = lr\n    optimizer.step()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize() # wait for GPU to finish all the scheduled work\n    t1= time.time()\n    dt = (t1-t0)*1000 # time diff in seconds\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T)/(t1-t0)\n    print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss.item()}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nTo replicate the effective batch size of around 0.5M, we can accumulate gradients using an inner for loop, track accumulated loss to print it correctly, and adjust the tokens per second calculation to account for the number of gradient accumulation steps:\n\n\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss_accum = 0.0 # need this  to correctly print the accumulated loss\n    for micro_step in range(grad_accum_steps):\n        x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n        x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n        with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n            logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        loss = loss/grad_accum_steps\n        loss_accum += loss.detach() # don't need to backpropagate through accumulation process\n        loss.backward() # deposits gradients by default\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    ...\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T*grad_accum_steps)/(t1-t0) # don't forget to adjust the tokens/second calculation \n    print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss_accum.item():.6f}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nNote in particular that the loss needs to be divided by grad_accum_steps. This is because the accumulator in F.cross_entropy loss is mean, whereas the loss within each grad_accum_steps loop does not account for averaging with the grad_accum_steps. To make this more concrete, without the gradient accumulation, the loss in the following simple regression example would include the division by 4:\n\n\nimport torch\n\nnet = torch.nn.Sequential(\n    torch.nn.Linear(16,32),\n    torch.nn.GELU(),\n    torch.nn.Linear(32,1)\n)\ntorch.random.manual_seed(42)\nx = torch.randn(4,16)\ny = torch.randn(4,1)\nnet.zero_grad()\nyhat = net(x)\nloss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y)\nloss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n\n# The loss objective, due to reduction='mean' is\n# L = 1/4*[\n#     (y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0150,  0.0011,  0.0042, -0.0040,  0.0059, -0.0080, -0.0078, -0.0138,\n        -0.0103, -0.0134])\n\n\n\nIf we compute the loss by adding the losses of the individual examples, we omit division by 4:\n\n\nnet.zero_grad()\nfor i in range(4):\n    yhat = net(x[i])\n    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y[i])\n    loss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n# The loss objective without reduction='mean' is\n# L = [\n#     (y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0598,  0.0042,  0.0167, -0.0161,  0.0235, -0.0320, -0.0311, -0.0550,\n        -0.0410, -0.0536])\n\n\n\nClearly, the gradients are not the same. To fix this, divide the loss by number of steps:\n\n\nnet.zero_grad()\nfor i in range(4):\n    yhat = net(x[i])\n    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y[i])\n    loss = loss/4\n    loss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n# The loss objective without reduction='mean' is\n# L = [\n#     (1/4)*(y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0150,  0.0011,  0.0042, -0.0040,  0.0059, -0.0080, -0.0078, -0.0138,\n        -0.0103, -0.0134])\n\n\n\nAlso note that casting our training loop in terms of effective batch size, we can adjust the size of our micro batch without changing the training dynamics: micro batch size is purely a performance optimization setting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DDP, we’ll have one process per GPU available. These will have the same model loaded but will be processing slightly different parts of the data. They’ll contribute their own gradients that will be averaged. DDP can be run with torchrun, which will correctly set the necessary environmental variables and launch distributed training.\n\n\n\n\nWhere we were before initializing device, we now also initialize distributed training as follows:\n\n\n# ----------------- Run distributed training -----------------\nfrom torch.distributed import init_process_group, destroy_process_group\nddp = int(os.environ.get('RANK',-1)) != -1 # is this a ddp run?\nif ddp:\n    assert torch.cuda.is_available()\n    init_process_group(backend='nccl')\n    ddp_rank = int(os.environ.get(\"RANK\"))\n    ddp_local_rank = int(os.environ['LOCAL_RANK'])\n    ddp_world_size = int(os.environ['WORLD_SIZE'])\n    device = f\"cuda:{ddp_local_rank}\"\n    torch.cuda.set_device(device)\n    master_process = ddp_rank==0\n    print(\"RANKS: \",ddp_rank,ddp_local_rank,ddp_world_size,device)\nelse:\n    ddp_rank = 0\n    ddp_local_rank = 0\n    ddp_world_size = 1\n    device = f\"cuda: {ddp_local_rank}\"\n    master_process = True\n    device = 'cpu'\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        device = 'cuda'\n        print(\"using GPU\")\n    elif hasattr(torch.backends, 'mps') and torch.backends.mps.is_available():\n        device = 'mps'\n        print(\"using MPS\")\n\n\nThere is a RANK variable assigned to each GPU (GPU 0 will have RANK of 0, GPU 1 will have RANK of 1, etc). Each of these processes will run on different parts of the data. LOCAL_RANK is only used in multi-node setting and represents the rank of a GPU on a single node. WORLD_SIZE is the total number of GPUs available.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince each GPU will need to run on a slightly different subset of our data, adjust the batch size and gradient accumulation as follows:\n\n\n# ----------------- Batch size -----------------\ntotal_batch_size = 524288 # 2**19 ~ 0.5M\nB = 8 # micro batch size on a 3090\nT = 1024\nassert total_batch_size % (B*T*ddp_world_size) == 0, 'make sure total_batch_size is divisible by B*T*ddp_world_size'\ngrad_accum_steps = total_batch_size//(B*T*ddp_world_size)\nif master_process:\n    print(f\"total desired batch size: {total_batch_size}\")\n    print(f\"=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: {grad_accum_steps}\")\n\n\nAlso, print on master process only to avoid duplicates prints arising from other processes.\n\n\n\n\nTo run on 2 GPUs, we can use torchrun –standalone –nproc_per_node=2 train_gpt2.py  (adjust 2 to the number of available GPUs).\n\n\n\n\n# ----------------- Data loader lite -----------------\nimport tiktoken\nclass DataLoaderLite:\n    def __init__(self, B, T, process_rank, num_processes): #1\n        self.B = B\n        self.T = T\n        self.process_rank = process_rank                   #2\n        self.num_processes = num_processes                 #3\n        # load the data from disk into memory\n        with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n            text = f.read()\n        enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')\n        self.tokens = torch.tensor(enc.encode(text))\n        print(f\"total tokens: {len(self.tokens)}\")\n        print(f\"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens)//(B*T)} batches\")\n    \n        self.current_position = self.B*self.T*self.process_rank\n    \n    def next_batch(self):\n        B, T = self.B, self.T\n        buf = self.tokens[self.current_position:self.current_position+B*T+1]\n        x = (buf[:-1]).view(B,T)\n        y = (buf[1:]).view(B,T)\n        self.current_position += B*T*self.num_processes                            #4\n        # if run out of tokens, loop around to zero\n        if self.current_position + (B*T*self.num_processes+1) &gt;= len(self.tokens): #5\n            self.current_position = self.B*self.T*self.process_rank                #6\n        return x, y\n...\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=B,T=T, process_rank=ddp_rank, num_processes=ddp_world_size)\n\n\nThe dataloader should now advance by B x T x num_processes so that each process (GPU) gets its own batch. To accomplish this, modify/add lines commented with #1-#6.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, identical model copies are initialized and compiled on each of the GPUs since each GPU is passes the same seed. In addition wrap the compiled model in a DDP container as follows:\n\n\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\n...\nmodel = torch.compile(model)\nif ddp:\n    model = DDP(model,device_ids=[ddp_local_rank])\n\n\nIn essence, DDP allows communication between the GPUs by averaging and synching the gradients. The forward pass will be identical, but once the backward pass is over, DDP will call allreduce to get the average across all the GPUs and deposit the average on every single GPU. In addition, DDP efficiently communicates the gradients while the backward pass is happening.\nIn addition, we should configure our optimizer using the ‘raw’ model that’s not wrapped in the DDP process:\n\n\nraw_model = model.module if ddp else model # always contains the unwrapped model\n...\noptimizer = raw_model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we only need the average of the gradients at the last of the gradient accumulation steps. The sanctioned way to do this is with ddp.no_sync context manager. Andrej notes that the context manager simply toggles the require_backward_grad_sync variable, noting that this is a risky move in case this variable disappears/gets renamed in future PyTorch versions.\n\n\nimport torch.distributed as dist\n...\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\n#optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(max_steps):\n    ...\n    for micro_step in range(grad_accum_steps):\n        ...\n        loss_accum += loss.detach() # don't need to backpropagate through accumulation process\n        if ddp: \n            model.require_backward_grad_sync = (micro_step==grad_accum_steps-1)\n        loss.backward() # deposits gradients by default\n    if ddp:\n        dist.all_reduce(loss_accum, op=dist.ReduceOp.AVG)\n    ...\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T*grad_accum_steps*ddp_world_size)/(t1-t0)\n    if master_process:\n        print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss_accum.item():.6f}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\nif ddp:\n    destroy_process_group()\n\n\nAlso, we want the average of all the losses from all the GPUs to be printed by the master process. The loss_accum tensor exists on all the ranks. Calling dist.all_reduce after the inner micro batch loop computes the average of loss_accums and deposits it on all the ranks. When we then print on the master process, the loss_accum that’s identical on all the ranks is printed.\n\nWe should also destroy the process group after the training is done to free up resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I got an error regarding device_type first time I ran the training. Andrej noted in is code “added after the video, pytorch can be serious about it’s device vs. device_type distinction”. This can be addressed as follows:\n\n\n# add after ddp init code\ndevice_type = \"cuda\" if device.startswith(\"cuda\") else \"cpu\"\n# set device type to device_type in the training loop\nwith torch.autocast(device_type=device_type, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n\n\nWe get the following training dynamics on two 3090s:\n\n\n\n\nDDP training dynamics on two 3090’s with micro-batch size of 8, image by the author.png\n\n\n\nThe loss is going down smoothly and about 100K tokens/second are processed. This is far short of 1.5M tokens/second that can be processed on 8xA100’s, of course, but it still looks like training GPT-2 locally should be feasible. Andrej later mentions that the ‘full’ trained GPT-2 can be reproduced in his setup in about an hour, so it would take around 15 hours on two 3090s.\n\nIn addition, Andrej mentioned that our current setup fixes the effective batch size, leaving the size of the micro batch as a tunable parameter. While the following choice slightly violates the “nice numbers” principle, I think it’s worth considering: Adjusting the effective batch to 512K and batch size to 10 so that micro batches with sequence length of 1024 evenly fit into the effective batch size, I could get the training to speed up to ~110K tokens/second, implying that the training time can be shortened to around 14 hours.\n\n\n\n\nDDP training dynamics on two 3090’s with micro-batch size of 10, image by the author.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDao, Tri, Daniel Y.

    "text": "Source: GPU utilization on a 3090 with batch size of 10, image by the author\n\n\n\nEach iteration would take about 720ms with batch size of 10 on a 3090 (vs 1000 on A100 with double the batch size!), so I expect my single-GPU training to be a bit slower than Andrej’s. With Andrej’s A100, it’s possible to process one epoch in 20 batches of size 16 with about 1000ms/batch, whereas with a 3090, it’s possible to process one epoch in 33 batches of size 10 with 730ms/batch, so about 20% slower than Andrej’s time (33x730/20x1000).\nAlso, Andrej suggests using nice numbers that have lots of multiples of 2. I tried a batch size of 8, but in this specific use case, I found that using batch size of 10 vs 8 is slightly faster per epoch on a 3090.\nAlso, to properly time the code, it’s important to wait until the GPU processes a batch before the CPU times the work. It’s possible that the CPU has loaded a batch onto GPU, GPU is still processing it, and the CPU has moved on to record the end time for the operation. To prevent this from happening, use torch.cuda.synchronize():\n\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=10,T=1024)\nmodel = GPT(GPTConfig())\nmodel.to(device)\n# create an optimizer object\noptimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\nfor i in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    #import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize() # wait for GPU to finish all the scheduled work\n    t1= time.time()\n    dt = (t1-t0)*1000 # time diff in seconds\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T)/(t1-t0)\n    print(f'iteration {i}, loss = {loss.item()}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nWe may change the batch size, so to get a more objective measure of training speed, look at tokens/second, which is 16.3K on an A100 and 14.1K on a 3090."

BF16 addresses these problems by preserving the original range of number.\nAndrej recommends studying the torch.autocast portion of mixed precision documentation, which has a context manager torch.autocast. This context manager is recommended around forward pass and loss calculation of the model only.\nWe thus only need to add one line of code as below:\n\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n    loss.backward()\n    ...\n\n\nUsing an interactive console breakpoint\n\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    ...\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n\n    loss.backward()\n    ...\n\n\nWe see that logits.dtype is indeed torch.bfloat16. Our weights remain in FP32, however, as model.transformer.wte.weight.dtype is torch.float32. This implies a mixed precision: PyTorch is keeping certain weights in full precision while converting others to bfloat16. What gets converted at what point is not exactly clear, but the general guidelines are below:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html\n\n\n\nThus matrix multiplications, addition, etc. get converted while layer norms, softmax, etc. do not since they are less robust to precision changes.\nOn an A100, our previous benchmark is 50K tokens/second and it goes up to 55K tokens/second with bfloat16, about a 10% speedup.\nOn a 3090, our previous benchmark is 19.6K tokens/second and it goes up to 27.5K tokens/second with bfloat16, about a 40% speedup, suggesting that 3090 was perhaps more memory-bound than the A100."

However, switching down to batch size of 8 yielded a significant increase the first time around. However, when I repeated the experiment, torch.compile ended up being faster with batch size of 10 again! This could have been due to graph breaks or kernel launch overhead.\n\nTaking the best runtime with torch.compile and batch size of 10, 27.4 K -&gt; 41.7 K tokens/second, or about 48% speedup over mixed precision benchmark.\n\n\n\n\nSource: initial training dynamics, image by the author\n\n\n\ntorch.compile does the following:\n\nTake out the Python interpreter from the forward pass and compile the neural net as a single object\nReduce GPU read/writes as demonstrated in the following example. Suppose we didn’t use torch.compile and instead of nn.GELU in our MLP, we used our own custom implementation below:\n\nclass TanhGELU(nn.Module):\ndef forward(self, x):\n    return 0.5 * x * (1.0 + torch.tanh(math.sqrt(2.0 / math.pi)*(x + 0.044715 * torch.pow(x, 3.0))))\n\nLooking at the following diagram, the input would first need to be placed from the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) onto the GPU for the torch.pow(x, 3.0) computation. Once the results are computed, they would be sent back to HBM. Next the computed result would be sent back to be multiplied by 0.044715 and so on. This would results many reads and writes to and from GPU and HBM, which are the bottleneck in many modern system.\nSince all the operations in the custom TanhGELU are element-wise operations, torch.compile can move the input to GPU and, for every single element, perform all the operations while the memory is on the GPU, then write back a single time. This is an example of kernel fusion, a major way in which torch.compile creates a speedup.\n\n\n\n\n\ngpu-cpu\n\n\n\nIn addition, when the data is moved to GPU for element-wise operations, it will need intermediate memory, a small amount of which is found on the GPU. Andrej points out that on the GPU chip itself, there is L2 cache. On the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that do the calculation, there’s L1 memory and registers. These use SRAM for fast access times and low power consumption vs transistors and capacitors implementation of HBM. Below is a typical diagram of memory and associated access speeds from Dao et al. (2022), Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\nmemory-hierarchy\n\n\n\nWith mixed precision and torch.compile optimizations, Andrej’s training on an A100 is about 3X faster than training on a 3090, with 125K tokens/second processed on an A100 and 41.5K tokens/second on a 3090."

This is because kernel fusion requires an algorithmic rewrite of how attention is currently implemented. While FlashAttention requires more FLOPs, it ends up being significantly faster because of its judicious use of the memory hierarchy, which leads to fewer read/writes between GPU and HBM.\n\nIn particular, the NxN attention matrix is never read from/written to HBM. It’s simple to perform the matrix multiplications in a streaming manner, but computing softmax this way is more of a challenge. The crux of the algorithmic rewrite is the online softmax trick, which incrementally computes the softmax without needing all the inputs as is customary for standard softmax normalization. The key insight is that the softmax function can be broken down into smaller chunks, computed independently on GPU, and then combined using a ‘softmax trick’ formula. This enables FlashAttention to process long sequences more efficiently, without having to materialize the entire attention matrix at once.\n\nIn more detail, from p.5 of Dao et al. (2022), the softmax trick uses intermediate m and l variables that combine the statistics from individual ‘attention submatrices’ to reconstruct the softmax for the entire attention matrix.\n\nWith FlashAttention in place, the four lines above become one line in the following code:\n\n\n\nclass CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config) -&gt; None:\n        ...\n    def forward(self, x):\n        ...\n        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C//self.n_head).transpose(1,2)\n        # -----Start: attention operation-----\n        y = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q,k,v, is_causal=True)\n        # -----End: attention operation-----\n        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) \n        ...\n\n\nThe loss after 50 iterations is identical to what it was before since FlashAttention is exact attention, not an approximation, so identical operations are performed. However, on a 3090, with FlashAttention added, about 50K tokens/second can be processed compared 41.7K tokens/second with just mixed precision+torch.compile, hence about a 20% speedup. On an A100, Andrej obtained about a 27% improvement."

    "text": "We’re looking for the numbers in our transformer to have as many powers of two as possible since GPU kernels work best with these. In particular, vocab_size is 50257, which is not odd; one simple way to change this is to round it up to 50304, which divides by 128 (2**7). This adds ‘fake’ tokens and increases the amount of computation, yet by working better with the GPU, it would generally lead to a speedup in training.\nNote that the vocab_size appears in the embedding and the classifier layer, and the extra tokens added there would never be used. The weight sharing implies that the network has to learn that the logits associated with the extra added rows need to be driven to zero, which is similar to how it is already learning to drive down weights for tokens not encountered in our training set.\nOn an A100, 4% improvement was observed; on a 3090, the training speed increased from 50K tokens/second to about 53 tokens/second, so about a 6% increase.\nAndrej elaborates on the reason for the speedup. Many of the CUDA kernels use block tiles, which are usually ‘nice numbers’ with many powers of 6, so calculations are done in powers of 64 or 32, for example. When the desired calculation does not neatly fit into these block tiles, less efficient boundary kernels come in to do the last part at the second pass.\nOptimizations targeted at GPT-2 specifically follow next."

    "text": "The relationship between weight decay, batch size, and learning rate is quite complex. In GPT-2, smaller batch size and bigger learning rate was likely used for smaller neural networks and larger batch size with smaller learning rate for larger ones. For the smallest network size, OpenAI used a batch size of 0.5M tokens. With 1024 tokens/batch, this implies a batch size of about 500. However, we would still like to use the effective batch size of 0.5M since it’s related to other hyperparameters determined by OpenAI. A solution to this is gradient accumulation, which allows us to simulate in a serial way any arbitrary batch size of our choice.\n\n\n# ----------------- Batch size -----------------\ntotal_batch_size = 524288 # 2**19 ~ 0.5M\nB = 8 # micro batch size on a 3090; switching down 10-&gt;8 since speeds are comparable and it factors evenly into total_batch_size above\nT = 1024\nassert total_batch_size % (B*T) == 0, 'make sure total_batch_size is divisible by B*T'\ngrad_accum_steps = total_batch_size//(B*T)\nprint(f\"total desired batch size: {total_batch_size}\")\nprint(f\"=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: {grad_accum_steps}\")\n\ntotal desired batch size: 524288\n=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: 64\n\n\n\nThus we’ll need to do 64 forward backward steps followed by a single gradient update. For context, our current training loop is\n\n\n\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n    x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n        logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        #import code; code.interact(local=locals())\n    loss.backward()\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration\n    lr = get_lr(step)\n    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:\n        param_group['lr'] = lr\n    optimizer.step()\n    torch.cuda.synchronize() # wait for GPU to finish all the scheduled work\n    t1= time.time()\n    dt = (t1-t0)*1000 # time diff in seconds\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T)/(t1-t0)\n    print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss.item()}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nTo replicate the effective batch size of around 0.5M, we can accumulate gradients using an inner for loop, track accumulated loss to print it correctly, and adjust the tokens per second calculation to account for the number of gradient accumulation steps:\n\n\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(50):\n    t0 = time.time()\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss_accum = 0.0 # need this  to correctly print the accumulated loss\n    for micro_step in range(grad_accum_steps):\n        x,y = train_loader.next_batch()\n        x,y = x.to(device), y.to(device)\n        with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n            logits, loss = model(x,y)\n        loss = loss/grad_accum_steps\n        loss_accum += loss.detach() # don't need to backpropagate through accumulation process\n        loss.backward() # deposits gradients by default\n    norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1.0)\n    ...\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T*grad_accum_steps)/(t1-t0) # don't forget to adjust the tokens/second calculation \n    print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss_accum.item():.6f}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\n\n\nNote in particular that the loss needs to be divided by grad_accum_steps. This is because the accumulator in F.cross_entropy loss is mean, whereas the loss within each grad_accum_steps loop does not account for averaging with the grad_accum_steps. To make this more concrete, without the gradient accumulation, the loss in the following simple regression example would include the division by 4:\n\n\nimport torch\n\nnet = torch.nn.Sequential(\n    torch.nn.Linear(16,32),\n    torch.nn.GELU(),\n    torch.nn.Linear(32,1)\n)\ntorch.random.manual_seed(42)\nx = torch.randn(4,16)\ny = torch.randn(4,1)\nnet.zero_grad()\nyhat = net(x)\nloss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y)\nloss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n\n# The loss objective, due to reduction='mean' is\n# L = 1/4*[\n#     (y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0150,  0.0011,  0.0042, -0.0040,  0.0059, -0.0080, -0.0078, -0.0138,\n        -0.0103, -0.0134])\n\n\n\nIf we compute the loss by adding the losses of the individual examples, we omit division by 4:\n\n\nnet.zero_grad()\nfor i in range(4):\n    yhat = net(x[i])\n    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y[i])\n    loss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n# The loss objective without reduction='mean' is\n# L = [\n#     (y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0598,  0.0042,  0.0167, -0.0161,  0.0235, -0.0320, -0.0311, -0.0550,\n        -0.0410, -0.0536])\n\n\n\nClearly, the gradients are not the same. To fix this, divide the loss by number of steps:\n\n\nnet.zero_grad()\nfor i in range(4):\n    yhat = net(x[i])\n    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat,y[i])\n    loss = loss/4\n    loss.backward()\nprint(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])\n# The loss objective without reduction='mean' is\n# L = [\n#     (1/4)*(y[0]-yhat[0])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[1]-yhat[1])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[2]-yhat[2])**2 +\n#     (1/4)*(y[3]-yhat[3])**2 \n# ]\n\ntensor([-0.0150,  0.0011,  0.0042, -0.0040,  0.0059, -0.0080, -0.0078, -0.0138,\n        -0.0103, -0.0134])\n\n\n\nAlso note that casting our training loop in terms of effective batch size, we can adjust the size of our micro batch without changing the training dynamics: micro batch size is purely a performance optimization setting."

    "text": "With DDP, we’ll have one process per GPU available. These will have the same model loaded but will be processing slightly different parts of the data. They’ll contribute their own gradients that will be averaged. DDP can be run with torchrun, which will correctly set the necessary environmental variables and launch distributed training.\n\n\n\n\nWhere we were before initializing device, we now also initialize distributed training as follows:\n\n\n# ----------------- Run distributed training -----------------\nfrom torch.distributed import init_process_group, destroy_process_group\nddp = int(os.environ.get('RANK',-1)) != -1 # is this a ddp run?\nif ddp:\n    assert torch.cuda.is_available()\n    init_process_group(backend='nccl')\n    ddp_rank = int(os.environ.get(\"RANK\"))\n    ddp_local_rank = int(os.environ['LOCAL_RANK'])\n    ddp_world_size = int(os.environ['WORLD_SIZE'])\n    device = f\"cuda:{ddp_local_rank}\"\n    torch.cuda.set_device(device)\n    master_process = ddp_rank==0\n    print(\"RANKS: \",ddp_rank,ddp_local_rank,ddp_world_size,device)\nelse:\n    ddp_rank = 0\n    ddp_local_rank = 0\n    ddp_world_size = 1\n    device = f\"cuda: {ddp_local_rank}\"\n    master_process = True\n    device = 'cpu'\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        device = 'cuda'\n        print(\"using GPU\")\n    elif hasattr(torch.backends, 'mps') and torch.backends.mps.is_available():\n        device = 'mps'\n        print(\"using MPS\")\n\n\nThere is a RANK variable assigned to each GPU (GPU 0 will have RANK of 0, GPU 1 will have RANK of 1, etc). Each of these processes will run on different parts of the data. LOCAL_RANK is only used in multi-node setting and represents the rank of a GPU on a single node. WORLD_SIZE is the total number of GPUs available.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince each GPU will need to run on a slightly different subset of our data, adjust the batch size and gradient accumulation as follows:\n\n\n# ----------------- Batch size -----------------\ntotal_batch_size = 524288 # 2**19 ~ 0.5M\nB = 8 # micro batch size on a 3090\nT = 1024\nassert total_batch_size % (B*T*ddp_world_size) == 0, 'make sure total_batch_size is divisible by B*T*ddp_world_size'\ngrad_accum_steps = total_batch_size//(B*T*ddp_world_size)\nif master_process:\n    print(f\"total desired batch size: {total_batch_size}\")\n    print(f\"=&gt; calculated gradient accumulation: {grad_accum_steps}\")\n\n\nAlso, print on master process only to avoid duplicates prints arising from other processes.\n\n\n\n\nTo run on 2 GPUs, we can use torchrun –standalone –nproc_per_node=2 train_gpt2.py  (adjust 2 to the number of available GPUs).\n\n\n\n\n# ----------------- Data loader lite -----------------\nimport tiktoken\nclass DataLoaderLite:\n    def __init__(self, B, T, process_rank, num_processes): #1\n        self.B = B\n        self.T = T\n        self.process_rank = process_rank                   #2\n        self.num_processes = num_processes                 #3\n        # load the data from disk into memory\n        with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n            text = f.read()\n        enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')\n        self.tokens = torch.tensor(enc.encode(text))\n        print(f\"total tokens: {len(self.tokens)}\")\n        print(f\"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens)//(B*T)} batches\")\n    \n        self.current_position = self.B*self.T*self.process_rank\n    \n    def next_batch(self):\n        B, T = self.B, self.T\n        buf = self.tokens[self.current_position:self.current_position+B*T+1]\n        x = (buf[:-1]).view(B,T)\n        y = (buf[1:]).view(B,T)\n        self.current_position += B*T*self.num_processes                            #4\n        # if run out of tokens, loop around to zero\n        if self.current_position + (B*T*self.num_processes+1) &gt;= len(self.tokens): #5\n            self.current_position = self.B*self.T*self.process_rank                #6\n        return x, y\n...\ntrain_loader = DataLoaderLite(B=B,T=T, process_rank=ddp_rank, num_processes=ddp_world_size)\n\n\nThe dataloader should now advance by B x T x num_processes so that each process (GPU) gets its own batch. To accomplish this, modify/add lines commented with #1-#6.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, identical model copies are initialized and compiled on each of the GPUs since each GPU is passes the same seed. In addition wrap the compiled model in a DDP container as follows:\n\n\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\n...\nmodel = torch.compile(model)\nif ddp:\n    model = DDP(model,device_ids=[ddp_local_rank])\n\n\nIn essence, DDP allows communication between the GPUs by averaging and synching the gradients. The forward pass will be identical, but once the backward pass is over, DDP will call allreduce to get the average across all the GPUs and deposit the average on every single GPU. In addition, DDP efficiently communicates the gradients while the backward pass is happening.\nIn addition, we should configure our optimizer using the ‘raw’ model that’s not wrapped in the DDP process:\n\n\nraw_model = model.module if ddp else model # always contains the unwrapped model\n...\noptimizer = raw_model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we only need the average of the gradients at the last of the gradient accumulation steps. The sanctioned way to do this is with ddp.no_sync context manager. Andrej notes that the context manager simply toggles the require_backward_grad_sync variable, noting that this is a risky move in case this variable disappears/gets renamed in future PyTorch versions.\n\n\nimport torch.distributed as dist\n...\n# ----------------- Training loop -----------------\n#optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)\noptimizer = model.configure_optimizers(weight_decay = 0.1, learning_rate = 6e-4, device_type = device)\nfor step in range(max_steps):\n    ...\n    for micro_step in range(grad_accum_steps):\n        ...\n        loss_accum += loss.detach() # don't need to backpropagate through accumulation process\n        if ddp: \n            model.require_backward_grad_sync = (micro_step==grad_accum_steps-1)\n        loss.backward() # deposits gradients by default\n    if ddp:\n        dist.all_reduce(loss_accum, op=dist.ReduceOp.AVG)\n    ...\n    tokens_per_sec = (train_loader.B*train_loader.T*grad_accum_steps*ddp_world_size)/(t1-t0)\n    if master_process:\n        print(f'iteration {step}, loss = {loss_accum.item():.6f}, norm: {norm:.4f}, lr: {lr:.4e}, dt: {dt: .2f}ms, toks/sec: {tokens_per_sec:.2f}')\nif ddp:\n    destroy_process_group()\n\n\nAlso, we want the average of all the losses from all the GPUs to be printed by the master process. The loss_accum tensor exists on all the ranks. Calling dist.all_reduce after the inner micro batch loop computes the average of loss_accums and deposits it on all the ranks. When we then print on the master process, the loss_accum that’s identical on all the ranks is printed.\n\nWe should also destroy the process group after the training is done to free up resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I got an error regarding device_type first time I ran the training. Andrej noted in is code “added after the video, pytorch can be serious about it’s device vs. device_type distinction”. This can be addressed as follows:\n\n\n# add after ddp init code\ndevice_type = \"cuda\" if device.startswith(\"cuda\") else \"cpu\"\n# set device type to device_type in the training loop\nwith torch.autocast(device_type=device_type, dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n    logits, loss = model(x,y)\n\n\nWe get the following training dynamics on two 3090s:\n\n\n\n\nDDP training dynamics on two 3090’s with micro-batch size of 8, image by the author.png\n\n\n\nThe loss is going down smoothly and about 100K tokens/second are processed. This is far short of 1.5M tokens/second that can be processed on 8xA100’s, of course, but it still looks like training GPT-2 locally should be feasible. Andrej later mentions that the ‘full’ trained GPT-2 can be reproduced in his setup in about an hour, so it would take around 15 hours on two 3090s.\n\nIn addition, Andrej mentioned that our current setup fixes the effective batch size, leaving the size of the micro batch as a tunable parameter. While the following choice slightly violates the “nice numbers” principle, I think it’s worth considering: Adjusting the effective batch to 512K and batch size to 10 so that micro batches with sequence length of 1024 evenly fit into the effective batch size, I could get the training to speed up to ~110K tokens/second, implying that the training time can be shortened to around 14 hours.\n\n\n\n\nDDP training dynamics on two 3090’s with micro-batch size of 10, image by the author.png"

The custom tokenizer will not match the GPT-2 tokenizer exactly (likely since there are implementation details OpenAI didn’t discuss) and will not be fast enough to use in it’s base Python version. However, the main goal here is to study the mechanics of the tokenization process.\nGPT-2 tokenizer uses the UTF-8 unicode encoding standard. In the context of UTF-8, a code point is a unique numerical value assigned to a character, symbol, or glyph in the Unicode character set. UTF-8 encodes ASCII characters in 1 byte, and may use up to 4 bytes for non-ASCII characters as described in the following Wikipedia article:\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\n\n\n\nBefore the text is tokenized, it is converted to UTF-8. This provides many advantages, including\n\nUnified representation across languages and scripts\nHandling of rare tokens\nBetter handling of ‘subwords’ for languages where this concept is different than, say, that of standard English\n\nA sample of Unicode text is below:\n\n\ntext = \"Ｕｎｉｃｏｄｅ!

finding and replacing the most common merge pairs:\n\n\n# 'train' the tokenizer\nvocab_size = 276\nnum_merges = vocab_size - 256\nids = list(tokens)\ninit_num_tokens = len(tokens)\nprint(init_num_tokens)\nmerges = dict()\nfor i in range(num_merges):\n    stats = get_stats(tokens)\n    top_pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n    tokens = merge(tokens, top_pair, 256+i)\n    merges[top_pair] = 256+i #don't forget to record that the pair of integers merged into newly minted int\nfinal_num_tokens = len(tokens)\nprint(final_num_tokens)\nprint(f\"compression ratio: {init_num_tokens/final_num_tokens:.2f}\")\n\n1116\n847\ncompression ratio: 1.32\n\n\n\nAndrej notes that every time we merge tokens they become eligible for a merge in the next round.\nHe also points out that the tokenizer is a completely separate step from the LLM training, it’s main purpose being to convert raw text to sequences of integers. The training step for the tokenizer may be different from the training data, perhaps being a multilingual mixture if we expect the model to be used with different languages in the future and we want compact representations for those languages.\nThe following is a way to decode a Unicode string of bytes:\n\n\n# Following Andrej, a bit thorny especially with error handling in .decode: \n# creating a mapping from byte values to byte objects, merging pairs of byte values into new byte objects, and providing a function to decode lists of byte values into strings.\nvocab = {idx: bytes([idx]) for idx in range(256)}\nfor (p0,p1), idx in merges.items(): # runs in insertion order post Python 3.7\n    vocab[idx] = vocab[p0] + vocab[p1]\n\ndef decode(ids):\n    # given ids (lists of ints), return a string\n    tokens = b\"\".join(vocab[idx] for idx in ids) # ids -&gt; tokens in raw byte form\n    text = tokens.decode(\"utf-8\",errors='replace')  # raw bytes -&gt; string; unicode chars can come in sequences of bytes and must come together to be decoded meaningfully \n    return text    \n\n\nThe idea with encoding is to find the pair with the lowest index from the merges dictionary obtained during training. This is because that pair got merged earliest. If there’s nothing to merge (float(’inf) returned),the pair would be the first element of stats and will not be in the merges dictionary. We should then break out of the while loop.\n\n\ndef encode(text):\n    # Given a string, return list of integers (tokens)\n    tokens = list(text.encode(\"utf-8\"))\n    while len(tokens)&gt;=2: # need at least 2 chars else stats will be empty, causing an issue inside min\n        stats = get_stats(tokens)\n        top_pair = min(stats,key=lambda pair: merges.get(pair,float('inf')))\n        if top_pair not in merges: break #nothing else can be merged\n        idx = merges[top_pair]\n        tokens = merge(tokens,top_pair,idx)\n        #del merges[top_pair] # my original idea with 'while merges:', Andrej's is better\n    return tokens            \n\n\n\n\nFollowing Andrej’s suggestion, I implemented the basic BPE tokenizer as an exercise:\n\n\nclass BasicTokenizer:\n    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:\n        self.merges = dict()\n        #self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n        \n    @staticmethod\n    def get_stats(ids, counts=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Given a list of integers, return a dictionary of counts of consecutive pairs\n        Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] -&gt; {(1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 1, (3, 1): 1}\n        Optionally allows to update an existing dictionary of counts\n        \"\"\"\n        counts = {} if counts is None else counts\n        for pair in zip(ids, ids[1:]): # iterate consecutive elements\n            counts[pair] = counts.get(pair, 0) + 1\n        return counts\n    \n    @staticmethod\n    def merge(ids, pair, idx):\n        \"\"\"Andrej's/DPV's implementations match\"\"\"\n        i = 0\n        out = []\n        while i &lt; len(ids):\n            if (i&lt;len(ids)-1) and(ids[i],ids[i+1])==pair:\n                out.append(idx)\n                i+=2 # merging!\n            else:\n                out.append(ids[i])\n                i+=1 #moving by one\n        return out\n    \n    def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False):\n        #vocab_size = 276\n        num_merges = vocab_size - 256\n        tokens = text.encode(\"utf-8\")\n        print(f\"tokens: {tokens}\")\n        init_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        for i in range(num_merges):\n            stats = BasicTokenizer.get_stats(tokens)\n            top_pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n            tokens = BasicTokenizer.merge(tokens, top_pair, 256+i)\n            self.merges[top_pair] = 256+i\n        final_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        if verbose:\n            print(init_num_tokens)\n            print(final_num_tokens)\n            print(f\"compression ratio: {init_num_tokens/final_num_tokens:.2f}\")\n            print(f\"merges: {self.merges}\")\n\n    def encode(self, text):\n        # Given a string, return list of integers (tokens)\n        tokens = list(text.encode(\"utf-8\"))\n        while len(tokens)&gt;=2:\n            stats = BasicTokenizer.get_stats(tokens)\n            top_pair = min(stats,key=lambda pair: self.merges.get(pair,float('inf')))\n            if top_pair not in self.merges: break\n            idx = self.merges[top_pair]\n            tokens = BasicTokenizer.merge(tokens,top_pair,idx)\n            #del self.merges[top_pair]\n        return tokens       \n    def decode(self, ids):\n        vocab = {idx: bytes([idx]) for idx in range(256)}\n        for (p0,p1), idx in self.merges.items():\n            vocab[idx] = vocab[p0] + vocab[p1]\n\n        # given ids (lists of ints), return a Python string\n        tokens = b\"\".join(vocab[idx] for idx in ids)\n        text = tokens.decode(\"utf-8\",errors='replace')        \n        return text \n\n\nI tested it to make sure it works on both the original Unicode text sample and on Taylor Swift’s Wikipedia page (which is on the longer spectrum of Wikipedia pages):\n\n\ntext = \"Ｕｎｉｃｏｄｅ!

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023\\xe2\\x80\\x932024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\\' World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\n\\nSwift\\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\\xc3\\xa9e Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\\nSwift\\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (n\\xc3\\xa9e Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York\\xe2\\x80\\x93based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004\\xe2\\x80\\x932008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x94the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\\xe2\\x80\\x94teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\\n2008\\xe2\\x80\\x932010: Fearless\\nTaylor Swift in 2009\\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie. She had a cameo appearance in the film and wrote two songs for its soundtrack.[71][72]\\nSwift\\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift\\'s honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008\\xe2\\x80\\x932009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s Pop Songs chart.[77] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album\\'s highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009\\'s top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift\\'s first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban\\'s Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]\\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009\\'s Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]\\nSwift featured on John Mayer\\'s single \"Half of My Heart\" and Boys Like Girls\\' single \"Two Is Better Than One\", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"You\\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine\\'s Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the US Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine\\'s Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode,[100] and she hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]\\n2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932014: Speak Now and Red\\nSwift singing into a mic while playing a banjo\\nSwift performing at the Speak Now World Tour in 2012\\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now.

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a \"bitch\".[173][174]\\nAfter briefly dating the English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song \"Better Man\" for the band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever\" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017).

The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[225] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards[226] and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the US.[227] Swift became the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore\\'s \"Cardigan\".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] According to Billboard, she was 2020\\'s highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide.[230]\\n2020\\xe2\\x80\\x932023: Re-recordings and Midnights\\n\\nSwift performing in 2022\\nFollowing the masters dispute, Swift released re-recordings of her first six studio albums, beginning with Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version) and Red (Taylor\\'s Version) in April and November 2021, respectively.

She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box.

Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background\\xe2\\x80\\x94a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files?

critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers.

Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[478] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[479] and received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[429] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[480][481] In 2014, she was named to Forbes\\' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[482] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[483] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes\\' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[484] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[485] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[245]\\nCultural status\\nMain articles: Cultural impact of Taylor Swift and Public image of Taylor Swift\\n\\nSwift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala\\nSwift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[486][487] She dominates cultural conversations,[488][489] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[490][491][492] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[297] Initially a teen idol,[493] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[312][494] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[495][496] In 2013, New York magazine\\'s Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world\\'s biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift\\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[501]\\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as \"America\\'s Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]\\nSwift\\'s private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift\\'s lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]\\nLegacy\\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we\\'re at this moment where there\\'s no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that\\'s on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[515]\\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]\\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[523] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[355][524] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[525][526] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[297] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[527][297]\\nSwift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[517][320][528] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[529][530] and reshaped ticketing models.[531] Various sources deem Swift\\'s music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[532] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[533] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[534] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[535] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[536] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[445] Senior artists such as Paul McCartney,[537] Mick Jagger,[538] Madonna,[539] and Dolly Parton have praised her musicianship.[540] Carole King regards Swift her \"professional grand daughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[541] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[542] while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles\\' successor.[543][544] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[545]\\nEntrepreneurship\\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[546][547] in 2024, she topped Billboard\\'s annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[548] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[549][550] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[551] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[552][553][554] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[555][487][556] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[557]\\nSwift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[558][559] designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,[560][561] released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,[562] and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One.[563][564] She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League\\'s Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[565][566] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[567][568]\\nSocial activism\\nFurther information: Political impact of Taylor Swift\\nSwift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[569] and is a founding signatory of the Time\\'s Up movement against sexual harassment.[570] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court\\'s decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[571] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[572] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[573][574] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[575][576][577]\\nA supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and

in the US presidential election.[584] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[585]\\nWealth\\nSwift\\'s net worth is estimated by Forbes and Bloomberg News at $1.1 billion as of

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\\' World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\n\\nSwift\\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\\nSwift\\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one.

She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\\'s newest raconteur.\"\\n—The Recording Academy, 2021[296]\\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red\\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"[309]\\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files?

critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[403]\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[416] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[417]\\nVideo and film\\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing.

This would combine semantics with punctuation, which is sub-optimal according to studies done by Radford et al. (2019).\nThe regex patterns used by GPT-2 and GPT-4 are below:\n\n\nimport regex\nGPT4_SPLIT_PATTERN = regex.compile(r\"\"\"'(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|[^\\r\\n\\p{L}\\p{N}]?+\\p{L}+|\\p{N}{1,3}| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]++[\\r\\n]*|\\s*[\\r\\n]|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+\"\"\")\nGPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN = regex.compile(r\"\"\"'s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+\"\"\")\n\n\nLooking at the example below,\n\n\nprint(regex.findall(GPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN,\"Hello're,     world! Here are the cats.\"))\n\n['Hello', \"'re\", ',', '    ', ' world', '!', ' Here', ' are', ' the', ' cats', '.']\n\n\nwe can make the following observations: - By breaking up the text this way, we’ll not be merging ‘e’, for example, as they are now parts of separate elements and we’ll only perform merges within elements.\n- GPT-2 pattern instructs the tokenizer not to merge across letters, numbers, punctuation, and select apostrophes. - re.IGNORECASE was not used in the original GPT-2 tokenizer, which means tokenization will not be consistent for uppercase and lowercase words containing apostrophes! - +(?!) is a negative lookahead assertion. It’s matching white spaces up to but not including the last white space. This consistently tokenizes start-of-word tokens with white space prepended to them.\nThere are additional rules other than chunking and BPE that are not clear from the original OpenAI implementation. For example 4 spaces in a succession would be likely merged by a tokenizer trained on Python code, which was likely the case. However, these spaces are not merged by the default GPT-2 tokenizer:\n\n\n\nSource: https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/?model=gpt2\n\n\n\nMy implementation of the BPE tokenizer with RegEx is below:\n\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport regex\nclass RegexTokenizer(BasicTokenizer):\n    def __init__(self,pattern) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__()\n        self.pattern = pattern\n    \n    def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False):\n        num_merges = vocab_size - 256\n        #--- Start: main regex modification ---#\n        raw_tokens = [token for token in regex.findall(self.pattern, text)]\n        encoded_tokens = [s.encode('utf-8') for s in raw_tokens]\n        tokens = b\"\".join(encoded_tokens)\n        #---   End: main regex modification ---#\n\n        init_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        for i in tqdm(range(num_merges)):\n            stats = RegexTokenizer.get_stats(tokens)\n            #top_pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n            max_freq = max(stats.values())\n            top_pairs = [pair for pair, freq in stats.items() if freq == max_freq]\n            top_pair = min(top_pairs)  # lexicographically smallest pair\n            tokens = RegexTokenizer.merge(tokens, top_pair, 256+i)\n            self.merges[top_pair] = 256+i\n        final_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        if verbose:\n            print(init_num_tokens)\n            print(final_num_tokens)\n            print(f\"compression ratio: {init_num_tokens/final_num_tokens:.2f}\")\n            print(f\"merges: {self.merges}\")\n\n\nBreaking down the main new lines above, it appears that the encoding checks out:\n\n\nraw_tokens = [token for token in regex.findall(GPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN, text)]\nencoded_tokens = [s.encode('utf-8') for s in raw_tokens]\ntokens = b\"\".join(encoded_tokens) \ntokens \n\nb'\\xef\\xbc\\xb5\\xef\\xbd\\x8e\\xef\\xbd\\x89\\xef\\xbd\\x83\\xef\\xbd\\x8f\\xef\\xbd\\x84\\xef\\xbd\\x85! \\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\xa4\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x9d\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x98\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x92\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x9e\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x93\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\xbd \\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb3\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xae\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb4\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xaa! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x84 The very name strikes fear and awe into the hearts of programmers worldwide.

Both appear to possess the same compression ratio (tokenized the sample text to 454 tokens to represent text of length 1024) on the chosen sample, and both successfully recover the original sequence. The main difference seems to come from Andrej’s tokenizer using get_stats on each chunk separately and merging pairs within the chunks separately, while mine merges pairs within the entire concatenated byte string. While this is slower (13:57 vs 03:18 on my machine), it is a more careful (and likely more ‘correct’) handling of the individual chunks. I would imagine the modern highly optimized tokenizers to perform tokenization on multiple chunks of text in parallel, aligning best with Andrej’s implementation.\nHowever, GPT-2 tokenizer appears to yield different tokens even with same vocabulary size. It also differs from the standard BPE tokenizer available from Hugging Face. Since not all details of GPT-2 tokenizer implementation are known (referring to 4-spaces not being merged for Python code, for example), this could be due to a custom implementation detail of GPT-2.\n\n\nprint(gpt2_custom.encode(text_sample).ids)\nprint(len(gpt2_custom.encode(text)))\n\n[248, 261, 81, 212, 4, 216, 103, 81, 209, 260, 321, 182, 6, 136, 309, 89, 195, 162, 4781, 87, 395, 1036, 1676, 6, 333, 178, 4, 155, 370, 81, 419, 5, 3323, 1709, 162, 85, 4781, 6, 136, 103, 215, 227, 87, 999, 125, 89, 135, 1062, 6, 72, 72, 1080, 1062, 145, 4, 154, 1188, 4, 182, 0, 1032, 190, 81, 610, 1709, 6, 1174, 175, 3679, 470, 87, 528, 354, 541, 125, 1703, 295, 72, 72, 164, 3973, 470, 87, 370, 85, 1709, 631, 162, 135, 799, 6, 677, 1062, 307, 87, 145, 4, 154, 341, 1207, 170, 3040, 4, 182, 6, 4921, 1011, 496, 464, 162, 4781, 235, 228, 72, 164, 307, 87, 145, 4, 154, 23, 500, 4, 944, 6, 792, 2025, 894, 212, 4, 158, 1466, 395, 81, 419, 5, 3323, 536, 188, 175, 235, 5155, 248, 261, 81, 212, 4, 216, 103, 81, 808, 87, 135, 729, 1049, 6, 122, 729, 1049, 253, 813, 87, 455, 6, 813, 87, 455, 287, 219, 452, 3404, 162, 628, 412, 6, 333, 178, 4, 85, 729, 1772, 186, 81, 220, 1515, 582, 81, 314, 6, 813, 267, 89, 1072, 85, 314, 1117, 4, 234, 455, 287, 219, 3404, 6, 72, 72, 762, 4, 808, 462, 89, 492, 85, 1772, 89, 343, 81, 2612, 6, 122, 2612, 103, 215, 2006, 6, 122, 2612, 1065, 278, 1428, 162, 628, 412, 87, 5314, 327, 264, 81, 4973, 6, 4359, 4, 85, 2612, 1065, 813, 87, 455, 3404, 172, 3178, 483, 828, 1072, 85]\n344\n\n\n\nprint(bpe_tokenizer.encode(text_sample).ids)\nprint(len(bpe_tokenizer.encode(text)))\n\n[211, 228, 56, 182, 4, 183, 79, 56, 177, 226, 282, 150, 6, 86, 277, 64, 162, 132, 4495, 63, 360, 971, 1574, 6, 220, 148, 4, 86, 334, 56, 376, 5, 3147, 1606, 132, 58, 4495, 6, 86, 79, 185, 196, 63, 934, 90, 64, 105, 966, 6, 47, 47, 217, 966, 119, 4, 125, 1110, 4, 150, 0, 145, 158, 56, 558, 1606, 6, 249, 126, 3479, 424, 63, 474, 313, 462, 90, 1601, 260, 47, 47, 393, 3752, 424, 63, 334, 58, 1606, 586, 132, 105, 742, 6, 105, 966, 275, 63, 119, 4, 125, 697, 1125, 131, 2871, 4, 150, 6, 755, 945, 448, 420, 132, 4495, 201, 197, 47, 393, 275, 63, 119, 4, 125, 23, 447, 4, 369, 6, 63, 1029, 811, 182, 4, 174, 1372, 360, 56, 376, 5, 3147, 489, 156, 126, 201, 4857, 3410, 228, 56, 182, 4, 183, 79, 56, 579, 63, 105, 666, 981, 6, 58, 666, 981, 222, 748, 63, 379, 6, 748, 63, 379, 253, 189, 407, 3230, 132, 575, 373, 6, 220, 148, 4, 58, 666, 1664, 153, 56, 188, 1400, 529, 56, 461, 6, 748, 233, 64, 1002, 58, 461, 1000, 4, 154, 379, 253, 189, 3230, 6, 47, 47, 468, 4, 579, 419, 64, 443, 58, 1664, 64, 303, 56, 2468, 6, 58, 2468, 79, 185, 1887, 6, 58, 2468, 995, 244, 1341, 132, 575, 373, 63, 4995, 291, 230, 56, 4690, 6, 1908, 4, 58, 2468, 995, 748, 63, 379, 3230, 103, 2658, 220, 766, 1002, 58]\n314\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that tokenizer trained directly from GPT-2 tokenizer using the Hugging Face library yielded a smaller compression ratio than the BPE tokenizer (344 vs 314 tokens to represent text of length 1024), and the compression ratio of these tokenizers was larger than that of our custom tokenizers.\nAlso, both GPT-2 and BPE tokenizer appear to be highly optimized, taking less than a second to train on our sample compared to minutes, implying that it’s the best move to understand the tokenization process and use an optimized off-the-shelf implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej makes a number or important points in the second half of the Let’s build the GPT Tokenizer video.\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 tokenizer fixed the case sensitivity pointed out above by making the match pattern case insensitive.\nIn additional to the encoder and decoder, GPT-2 also has byte_encoder and byte_decoder methods that don’t add substantially to the implementation.\n\nGPT-2 tokenizer’s vocab size of 50257 comes from 256 raw byte tokens, 50000 merges, and the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token.\n\nModern tokenizers, such as the gpt-3.5-turbo tokenizer, also have other special tokens such as &lt;|imstart|&gt;, &lt;|imend|&gt;, etc, where ‘im’ stands for ‘imaginary monologue’ to delimit chat conversations, for example. tiktoken library allows addition of these special tokens.\nAdding special tokens necessitates transformer model surgery to add the tokens in the embedding matrix and the classifier layer.\nAs noted above, tiktoken does not provide the train function, just the inference code.\n\n\n\n\n\nsentencepiece provices a train function and works on the level of code points, not bytes, falling back to UTF-8 if it encounters unknown tokens.\nIt also tries to split out sentences, which could be challenging since many syntactic units do not squarely fall within sentence/no-sentence category.\nBy default sentencepiece adds white spaces in front of strings that are not at the start of sentences for consistency of treating words occurring at the start and in the middle of sentences.\nIn Andrej’s experience, sentencepiece documentation is lacking a bit at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith larger vocabulary size, more tokens can be compressed and included within a given context length, but there would also be fewer of a given token for a language model to train on.\nWhile the greater amount of information included within a context window is generally beneficial, too much of it due to a large vocab size is likely not give the model enough time to ‘think’ as it’s attending to the tokens. Thus vocab size can be viewed as a hyperparameter of the model.\nIf we’re finetuning and want to add special tokens (eg, for using a browser), we would resize the embedding and the weights, then could freeze the original weights and finetune just the new parameters.\nThere is a gist tokens compression technique where new tokens are introduced and the model is trained by distillation, training just the embedding representations of the new tokens such that the behavior of this language model is identical to that of a model with a very long prompt. This is shown in the following diagram:\n\n\n\n\nSource: Mu, J., Li, X. L., & Goodman, N. (2023).\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to tokenize non-language data (eg, images), and use the transformer architecture for autoregressive or diffusion models (Sora is an example).\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej’s answers to the following questions are below.\nWhy can’t LLM spell words?\n\nAK: Characters are chunked up into tokens, some of which are long (a model with a ‘:DefaultCellStyle’ token will not be able to answer spelling questions about it). Also, if ‘:DefaultCellSty’ is passed to the model, the model generation will likely stop since it has never seen just a chunk of the token in it’s vocabulary and such chunks are outside of the model’s distribution.\n\nWhy can’t LLM do super simple string processing tasks like reversing a string?\n\nAK: Similarly, reversing a single long token would be challenging to a model unless it’s first prompted to list out the individual characters.\n\n\nWhy is LLM worse at non-English languages (e.g. Japanese)?\n\nAK: Tokenizers are not sufficiently trained on non-English data and as a consequence do not compress it sufficiently.\n\nWhy is LLM bad at simple arithmetic?\n\nAK: Addition algorithm is character-level, yet integers are not split up consistently (sometimes into 1, or 2, or 3 digits).\n\nWhy did GPT-2 have more than necessary trouble coding in Python?\n\nAK: Encoding efficiency of the GPT-2 tokenizer was not great since tabs did not get encoded into single tokens, for example.\n\nWhy did my LLM abruptly halt when it sees the string “&lt;|endoftext|&gt;”?\n\nAK: Something is breaking as this token does not seem to be handled properly: questions to LLMs containing it end up unanswered as this token appears to be parsed when it shouldn’t be when coming from a user that could attack the system.\n\nWhat is this weird warning I get about a “trailing whitespace”?\n\nAK: Prompting ending in trailing space sent to instruct models cause sampling inefficiency since tokens at the beginning of words already start with a space and adding an extra space is out of distribution for the model.\n\n\nWhy did the LLM break if I ask it about “SolidGoldMagikarp”?\n\nAK: There’s an internet-famous blog examining clusters of tokens based on their embeddings. When these tokens are used in questions to an LLM that had these tokens in its tokenizer, the model may respond with evasion, hallucination, insults, etc. The likely cause of this is the discrepancy between tokenization and training datasets. In the tokenization dataset, tokens for popular Reddit users such as SolidGoldMagikarp got merged into their own tokens. However, the token likely never appeared in the training data, and the token never got sampled and ‘trained’. Then at test time, giving this token to the model leads to undefined behavior.\n\n\nWhy should I prefer to use YAML over JSON with LLMs?\n\nAK: YAMLs generally end up being tokenized into fewer tokens than JSONs and hence are more economical.\n\n\nWhy is LLM not actually end-to-end language modeling?\n\nAK: Tokenization.\n\nWhat is the real root of suffering?\n\nAK: Andrej really dislikes tokenization ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu, J., Li, X.

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023\\xe2\\x80\\x932024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\\' World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\n\\nSwift\\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\\xc3\\xa9e Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\\nSwift\\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (n\\xc3\\xa9e Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York\\xe2\\x80\\x93based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004\\xe2\\x80\\x932008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x94the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\\xe2\\x80\\x94teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\\n2008\\xe2\\x80\\x932010: Fearless\\nTaylor Swift in 2009\\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie. She had a cameo appearance in the film and wrote two songs for its soundtrack.[71][72]\\nSwift\\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift\\'s honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008\\xe2\\x80\\x932009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s Pop Songs chart.[77] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album\\'s highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009\\'s top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift\\'s first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban\\'s Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]\\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009\\'s Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]\\nSwift featured on John Mayer\\'s single \"Half of My Heart\" and Boys Like Girls\\' single \"Two Is Better Than One\", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"You\\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine\\'s Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the US Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine\\'s Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode,[100] and she hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]\\n2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932014: Speak Now and Red\\nSwift singing into a mic while playing a banjo\\nSwift performing at the Speak Now World Tour in 2012\\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now.

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a \"bitch\".[173][174]\\nAfter briefly dating the English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song \"Better Man\" for the band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever\" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017).

The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[225] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards[226] and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the US.[227] Swift became the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore\\'s \"Cardigan\".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] According to Billboard, she was 2020\\'s highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide.[230]\\n2020\\xe2\\x80\\x932023: Re-recordings and Midnights\\n\\nSwift performing in 2022\\nFollowing the masters dispute, Swift released re-recordings of her first six studio albums, beginning with Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version) and Red (Taylor\\'s Version) in April and November 2021, respectively.

She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box.

Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background\\xe2\\x80\\x94a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files?

critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers.

Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[478] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[479] and received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[429] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[480][481] In 2014, she was named to Forbes\\' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[482] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[483] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes\\' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[484] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[485] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[245]\\nCultural status\\nMain articles: Cultural impact of Taylor Swift and Public image of Taylor Swift\\n\\nSwift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala\\nSwift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[486][487] She dominates cultural conversations,[488][489] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[490][491][492] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[297] Initially a teen idol,[493] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[312][494] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[495][496] In 2013, New York magazine\\'s Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world\\'s biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift\\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[501]\\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as \"America\\'s Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]\\nSwift\\'s private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift\\'s lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]\\nLegacy\\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we\\'re at this moment where there\\'s no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that\\'s on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[515]\\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]\\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[523] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[355][524] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[525][526] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[297] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[527][297]\\nSwift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[517][320][528] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[529][530] and reshaped ticketing models.[531] Various sources deem Swift\\'s music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[532] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[533] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[534] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[535] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[536] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[445] Senior artists such as Paul McCartney,[537] Mick Jagger,[538] Madonna,[539] and Dolly Parton have praised her musicianship.[540] Carole King regards Swift her \"professional grand daughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[541] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[542] while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles\\' successor.[543][544] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[545]\\nEntrepreneurship\\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[546][547] in 2024, she topped Billboard\\'s annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[548] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[549][550] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[551] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[552][553][554] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[555][487][556] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[557]\\nSwift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[558][559] designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,[560][561] released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,[562] and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One.[563][564] She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League\\'s Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[565][566] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[567][568]\\nSocial activism\\nFurther information: Political impact of Taylor Swift\\nSwift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[569] and is a founding signatory of the Time\\'s Up movement against sexual harassment.[570] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court\\'s decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[571] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[572] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[573][574] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[575][576][577]\\nA supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and

in the US presidential election.[584] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[585]\\nWealth\\nSwift\\'s net worth is estimated by Forbes and Bloomberg News at $1.1 billion as of

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\\' World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\n\\nSwift\\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\\nSwift\\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one.

She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\\'s newest raconteur.\"\\n—The Recording Academy, 2021[296]\\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red\\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"[309]\\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files?

critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[403]\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[416] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[417]\\nVideo and film\\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing.

    "text": "The ‘naive’ BPE implementation would merge common words occuring with different punctuation into single tokens: For example, ‘dog.’, ‘dog!’, and ‘dog?’ are likely to become individual tokens. This would combine semantics with punctuation, which is sub-optimal according to studies done by Radford et al. (2019).\nThe regex patterns used by GPT-2 and GPT-4 are below:\n\n\nimport regex\nGPT4_SPLIT_PATTERN = regex.compile(r\"\"\"'(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|[^\\r\\n\\p{L}\\p{N}]?+\\p{L}+|\\p{N}{1,3}| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]++[\\r\\n]*|\\s*[\\r\\n]|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+\"\"\")\nGPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN = regex.compile(r\"\"\"'s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+\"\"\")\n\n\nLooking at the example below,\n\n\nprint(regex.findall(GPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN,\"Hello're,     world! Here are the cats.\"))\n\n['Hello', \"'re\", ',', '    ', ' world', '!', ' Here', ' are', ' the', ' cats', '.']\n\n\nwe can make the following observations: - By breaking up the text this way, we’ll not be merging ‘e’, for example, as they are now parts of separate elements and we’ll only perform merges within elements.\n- GPT-2 pattern instructs the tokenizer not to merge across letters, numbers, punctuation, and select apostrophes. - re.IGNORECASE was not used in the original GPT-2 tokenizer, which means tokenization will not be consistent for uppercase and lowercase words containing apostrophes! - +(?!) is a negative lookahead assertion. It’s matching white spaces up to but not including the last white space. This consistently tokenizes start-of-word tokens with white space prepended to them.\nThere are additional rules other than chunking and BPE that are not clear from the original OpenAI implementation. For example 4 spaces in a succession would be likely merged by a tokenizer trained on Python code, which was likely the case. However, these spaces are not merged by the default GPT-2 tokenizer:\n\n\n\nSource: https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/?model=gpt2\n\n\n\nMy implementation of the BPE tokenizer with RegEx is below:\n\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport regex\nclass RegexTokenizer(BasicTokenizer):\n    def __init__(self,pattern) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__()\n        self.pattern = pattern\n    \n    def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False):\n        num_merges = vocab_size - 256\n        #--- Start: main regex modification ---#\n        raw_tokens = [token for token in regex.findall(self.pattern, text)]\n        encoded_tokens = [s.encode('utf-8') for s in raw_tokens]\n        tokens = b\"\".join(encoded_tokens)\n        #---   End: main regex modification ---#\n\n        init_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        for i in tqdm(range(num_merges)):\n            stats = RegexTokenizer.get_stats(tokens)\n            #top_pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n            max_freq = max(stats.values())\n            top_pairs = [pair for pair, freq in stats.items() if freq == max_freq]\n            top_pair = min(top_pairs)  # lexicographically smallest pair\n            tokens = RegexTokenizer.merge(tokens, top_pair, 256+i)\n            self.merges[top_pair] = 256+i\n        final_num_tokens = len(tokens)\n        if verbose:\n            print(init_num_tokens)\n            print(final_num_tokens)\n            print(f\"compression ratio: {init_num_tokens/final_num_tokens:.2f}\")\n            print(f\"merges: {self.merges}\")\n\n\nBreaking down the main new lines above, it appears that the encoding checks out:\n\n\nraw_tokens = [token for token in regex.findall(GPT2_SPLIT_PATTERN, text)]\nencoded_tokens = [s.encode('utf-8') for s in raw_tokens]\ntokens = b\"\".join(encoded_tokens) \ntokens \n\nb'\\xef\\xbc\\xb5\\xef\\xbd\\x8e\\xef\\xbd\\x89\\xef\\xbd\\x83\\xef\\xbd\\x8f\\xef\\xbd\\x84\\xef\\xbd\\x85! \\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\xa4\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x9d\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x98\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x92\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x9e\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x93\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\xbd \\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb3\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xae\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb4\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xaa! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x84 The very name strikes fear and awe into the hearts of programmers worldwide.

[375])\n\n\n\nMy tokenizer behaves similarly to Andrej’s, with most merges happening around the same time. Both appear to possess the same compression ratio (tokenized the sample text to 454 tokens to represent text of length 1024) on the chosen sample, and both successfully recover the original sequence. The main difference seems to come from Andrej’s tokenizer using get_stats on each chunk separately and merging pairs within the chunks separately, while mine merges pairs within the entire concatenated byte string. While this is slower (13:57 vs 03:18 on my machine), it is a more careful (and likely more ‘correct’) handling of the individual chunks. I would imagine the modern highly optimized tokenizers to perform tokenization on multiple chunks of text in parallel, aligning best with Andrej’s implementation.\nHowever, GPT-2 tokenizer appears to yield different tokens even with same vocabulary size. It also differs from the standard BPE tokenizer available from Hugging Face. Since not all details of GPT-2 tokenizer implementation are known (referring to 4-spaces not being merged for Python code, for example), this could be due to a custom implementation detail of GPT-2.\n\n\nprint(gpt2_custom.encode(text_sample).ids)\nprint(len(gpt2_custom.encode(text)))\n\n[248, 261, 81, 212, 4, 216, 103, 81, 209, 260, 321, 182, 6, 136, 309, 89, 195, 162, 4781, 87, 395, 1036, 1676, 6, 333, 178, 4, 155, 370, 81, 419, 5, 3323, 1709, 162, 85, 4781, 6, 136, 103, 215, 227, 87, 999, 125, 89, 135, 1062, 6, 72, 72, 1080, 1062, 145, 4, 154, 1188, 4, 182, 0, 1032, 190, 81, 610, 1709, 6, 1174, 175, 3679, 470, 87, 528, 354, 541, 125, 1703, 295, 72, 72, 164, 3973, 470, 87, 370, 85, 1709, 631, 162, 135, 799, 6, 677, 1062, 307, 87, 145, 4, 154, 341, 1207, 170, 3040, 4, 182, 6, 4921, 1011, 496, 464, 162, 4781, 235, 228, 72, 164, 307, 87, 145, 4, 154, 23, 500, 4, 944, 6, 792, 2025, 894, 212, 4, 158, 1466, 395, 81, 419, 5, 3323, 536, 188, 175, 235, 5155, 248, 261, 81, 212, 4, 216, 103, 81, 808, 87, 135, 729, 1049, 6, 122, 729, 1049, 253, 813, 87, 455, 6, 813, 87, 455, 287, 219, 452, 3404, 162, 628, 412, 6, 333, 178, 4, 85, 729, 1772, 186, 81, 220, 1515, 582, 81, 314, 6, 813, 267, 89, 1072, 85, 314, 1117, 4, 234, 455, 287, 219, 3404, 6, 72, 72, 762, 4, 808, 462, 89, 492, 85, 1772, 89, 343, 81, 2612, 6, 122, 2612, 103, 215, 2006, 6, 122, 2612, 1065, 278, 1428, 162, 628, 412, 87, 5314, 327, 264, 81, 4973, 6, 4359, 4, 85, 2612, 1065, 813, 87, 455, 3404, 172, 3178, 483, 828, 1072, 85]\n344\n\n\n\nprint(bpe_tokenizer.encode(text_sample).ids)\nprint(len(bpe_tokenizer.encode(text)))\n\n[211, 228, 56, 182, 4, 183, 79, 56, 177, 226, 282, 150, 6, 86, 277, 64, 162, 132, 4495, 63, 360, 971, 1574, 6, 220, 148, 4, 86, 334, 56, 376, 5, 3147, 1606, 132, 58, 4495, 6, 86, 79, 185, 196, 63, 934, 90, 64, 105, 966, 6, 47, 47, 217, 966, 119, 4, 125, 1110, 4, 150, 0, 145, 158, 56, 558, 1606, 6, 249, 126, 3479, 424, 63, 474, 313, 462, 90, 1601, 260, 47, 47, 393, 3752, 424, 63, 334, 58, 1606, 586, 132, 105, 742, 6, 105, 966, 275, 63, 119, 4, 125, 697, 1125, 131, 2871, 4, 150, 6, 755, 945, 448, 420, 132, 4495, 201, 197, 47, 393, 275, 63, 119, 4, 125, 23, 447, 4, 369, 6, 63, 1029, 811, 182, 4, 174, 1372, 360, 56, 376, 5, 3147, 489, 156, 126, 201, 4857, 3410, 228, 56, 182, 4, 183, 79, 56, 579, 63, 105, 666, 981, 6, 58, 666, 981, 222, 748, 63, 379, 6, 748, 63, 379, 253, 189, 407, 3230, 132, 575, 373, 6, 220, 148, 4, 58, 666, 1664, 153, 56, 188, 1400, 529, 56, 461, 6, 748, 233, 64, 1002, 58, 461, 1000, 4, 154, 379, 253, 189, 3230, 6, 47, 47, 468, 4, 579, 419, 64, 443, 58, 1664, 64, 303, 56, 2468, 6, 58, 2468, 79, 185, 1887, 6, 58, 2468, 995, 244, 1341, 132, 575, 373, 63, 4995, 291, 230, 56, 4690, 6, 1908, 4, 58, 2468, 995, 748, 63, 379, 3230, 103, 2658, 220, 766, 1002, 58]\n314\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that tokenizer trained directly from GPT-2 tokenizer using the Hugging Face library yielded a smaller compression ratio than the BPE tokenizer (344 vs 314 tokens to represent text of length 1024), and the compression ratio of these tokenizers was larger than that of our custom tokenizers.\nAlso, both GPT-2 and BPE tokenizer appear to be highly optimized, taking less than a second to train on our sample compared to minutes, implying that it’s the best move to understand the tokenization process and use an optimized off-the-shelf implementation."

    "text": "Andrej makes a number or important points in the second half of the Let’s build the GPT Tokenizer video.\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 tokenizer fixed the case sensitivity pointed out above by making the match pattern case insensitive.\nIn additional to the encoder and decoder, GPT-2 also has byte_encoder and byte_decoder methods that don’t add substantially to the implementation.\n\nGPT-2 tokenizer’s vocab size of 50257 comes from 256 raw byte tokens, 50000 merges, and the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token.\n\nModern tokenizers, such as the gpt-3.5-turbo tokenizer, also have other special tokens such as &lt;|imstart|&gt;, &lt;|imend|&gt;, etc, where ‘im’ stands for ‘imaginary monologue’ to delimit chat conversations, for example. tiktoken library allows addition of these special tokens.\nAdding special tokens necessitates transformer model surgery to add the tokens in the embedding matrix and the classifier layer.\nAs noted above, tiktoken does not provide the train function, just the inference code.\n\n\n\n\n\nsentencepiece provices a train function and works on the level of code points, not bytes, falling back to UTF-8 if it encounters unknown tokens.\nIt also tries to split out sentences, which could be challenging since many syntactic units do not squarely fall within sentence/no-sentence category.\nBy default sentencepiece adds white spaces in front of strings that are not at the start of sentences for consistency of treating words occurring at the start and in the middle of sentences.\nIn Andrej’s experience, sentencepiece documentation is lacking a bit at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith larger vocabulary size, more tokens can be compressed and included within a given context length, but there would also be fewer of a given token for a language model to train on.\nWhile the greater amount of information included within a context window is generally beneficial, too much of it due to a large vocab size is likely not give the model enough time to ‘think’ as it’s attending to the tokens. Thus vocab size can be viewed as a hyperparameter of the model.\nIf we’re finetuning and want to add special tokens (eg, for using a browser), we would resize the embedding and the weights, then could freeze the original weights and finetune just the new parameters.\nThere is a gist tokens compression technique where new tokens are introduced and the model is trained by distillation, training just the embedding representations of the new tokens such that the behavior of this language model is identical to that of a model with a very long prompt. This is shown in the following diagram:\n\n\n\n\nSource: Mu, J., Li, X. L., & Goodman, N. (2023).\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to tokenize non-language data (eg, images), and use the transformer architecture for autoregressive or diffusion models (Sora is an example).\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej’s answers to the following questions are below.\nWhy can’t LLM spell words?\n\nAK: Characters are chunked up into tokens, some of which are long (a model with a ‘:DefaultCellStyle’ token will not be able to answer spelling questions about it). Also, if ‘:DefaultCellSty’ is passed to the model, the model generation will likely stop since it has never seen just a chunk of the token in it’s vocabulary and such chunks are outside of the model’s distribution.\n\nWhy can’t LLM do super simple string processing tasks like reversing a string?\n\nAK: Similarly, reversing a single long token would be challenging to a model unless it’s first prompted to list out the individual characters.\n\n\nWhy is LLM worse at non-English languages (e.g. Japanese)?\n\nAK: Tokenizers are not sufficiently trained on non-English data and as a consequence do not compress it sufficiently.\n\nWhy is LLM bad at simple arithmetic?\n\nAK: Addition algorithm is character-level, yet integers are not split up consistently (sometimes into 1, or 2, or 3 digits).\n\nWhy did GPT-2 have more than necessary trouble coding in Python?\n\nAK: Encoding efficiency of the GPT-2 tokenizer was not great since tabs did not get encoded into single tokens, for example.\n\nWhy did my LLM abruptly halt when it sees the string “&lt;|endoftext|&gt;”?\n\nAK: Something is breaking as this token does not seem to be handled properly: questions to LLMs containing it end up unanswered as this token appears to be parsed when it shouldn’t be when coming from a user that could attack the system.\n\nWhat is this weird warning I get about a “trailing whitespace”?\n\nAK: Prompting ending in trailing space sent to instruct models cause sampling inefficiency since tokens at the beginning of words already start with a space and adding an extra space is out of distribution for the model.\n\n\nWhy did the LLM break if I ask it about “SolidGoldMagikarp”?\n\nAK: There’s an internet-famous blog examining clusters of tokens based on their embeddings. When these tokens are used in questions to an LLM that had these tokens in its tokenizer, the model may respond with evasion, hallucination, insults, etc. The likely cause of this is the discrepancy between tokenization and training datasets. In the tokenization dataset, tokens for popular Reddit users such as SolidGoldMagikarp got merged into their own tokens. However, the token likely never appeared in the training data, and the token never got sampled and ‘trained’. Then at test time, giving this token to the model leads to undefined behavior.\n\n\nWhy should I prefer to use YAML over JSON with LLMs?\n\nAK: YAMLs generally end up being tokenized into fewer tokens than JSONs and hence are more economical.\n\n\nWhy is LLM not actually end-to-end language modeling?\n\nAK: Tokenization.\n\nWhat is the real root of suffering?\n\nAK: Andrej really dislikes tokenization ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

    "text": "This is Part 3 of building, optimizing, and training GPT-2 from scratch. In this part, I’ll train GPT-2-style transformer on the Tiny Stories dataset, which is a synthetic dataset of children’s stories produced by Microsoft Research. Since this dataset has shorter sequences and limited vocabulary, this is an opportunity to adjust both the tokenizer and the GPT-2 transformer to further speed up training. To this end, I’ll first train a Hugging Face tokenizer since OpenAI’s original tiktoken tokenizer cannot be trained. I’ll also show how to adjust Andrej’s code to be used with the Hugging Face tokenizer.\n\n\n\n\nI’ll first train the tokenizer using the method recommended by Hugging Face. I may loop back to this to replicate it from scratch in a later notebook.\n\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ntiny_stories_ds=load_dataset(\"roneneldan/TinyStories\")\n\ndef get_training_corpus(dataset,split='train',field='text'):\n    dataset = dataset[split]\n    for start_idx in range(0, len(dataset), 1024): #using a power of 2, why not...\n        yield dataset[start_idx:start_idx+1024][field]\ntraining_corpus = get_training_corpus(tiny_stories_ds)\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nold_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\n\ntokenizer = old_tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(training_corpus,vocab_size=6400) # don't forget to adjust the training script with this number!\ntokenizer.save_pretrained('./tokenizer/tiny_stories_tokenizer')\n\n\nMost common words get encoded in a single token\n\ntokenizer.encode(' dog'),tokenizer.encode(' girl'), tokenizer.encode(' bird'),tokenizer.encode(' dad'),tokenizer.encode(' mom'),tokenizer.encode(' cat'),tokenizer.encode(' Lily') yields\n([634], [446], [537], [648], [365], [701], [364]) - Note the presence of space before the common words: this is how GPT-2 encodes words by default.\n\nRunning some experiments on the tokenizer length, here are some statistics on a random subset of size 10000 tokenized with tokenizers with various vocabulary sizes:\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: graph made by the author\n\n\n\nAs expected, as tokenizer size decreases, the average number of tokens per story increases and the distribution of tokens needed per story shifts to the rights slightly. Regardless, almost 97% of the stories can be tokenized in their entirety by 512 tokens or less. I thus choose to shrink the sequence length from 1024 to 512: critically, this will reduce the amount of memory taken by the embedding matrices and the activations, allowing me to use much bigger batch sizes per GPU (64 instead of 8 or 10) during training. This leads to further memory speed-ups.\n\nNote that 512 is still a multiple of 32, agreeing with recommendations by both Andrej and Anthony et al (2024).\nAlso, the model would be ~91M parameters rather than 126M parameters of the original GPT-2 small.\nShrinking just the vocab size but not the sequence length increases the training speed from 110K tokens/second with default GPT-2 setup from Part 2 to about 150K tokens/second.\nReducing both the vocab size and the sequence length further speeds up the training to 162K tokens/second, about 47% training speed-up overall.\n\nThe tinystories dataset has 2.12M stories. At about 200 tokens/story at vocab size of 6400, this makes for about 420M tokens. With vocab size shrunk to 6400, I’m able to process batches of size 32 with 1024 tokens/batch per each of the two GPUs, I’m able to process 150K tokens/second, leading to about an 8-hour training run for a full pass through the data.\nIn addition, 96.75% of the stories are under 512 tokens in length. Reducing the sequence length to 512 allows us to increase the batch size to 64 and speeds up training to 162K tokens/second.\n\n\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 train_gpt2.py \n\n\ntorchrun shows the following warning: “Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable for each process to be 1 in default, to avoid your system being overloaded, please further tune the variable for optimal performance in your application as needed.” I have 24 threads on my machine (can find this out with nproc), so setting export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 to let each GPU access 8 threads.\nNow 405M tokens (2.12M stories at 191 tokens/story on average) at 131072 (64 batch size/GPU x 512 sequence length x 2 GPUs) tokens processed/step would take at most 6200 steps for a full epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside fineweb.py, Andrej’s setup and tokenize function are as follows:\n\n\nimport tiktoken\nfw = load_dataset(\"HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu\", name=remote_name, split=\"train\")\n# init the tokenizer\nenc = tiktoken.get_encoding(\"gpt2\")\neot = enc._special_tokens['&lt;|endoftext|&gt;'] # end of text token\ndef tokenize(doc):\n    # tokenizes a single document and returns a numpy array of uint16 tokens\n    tokens = [eot] # the special &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token delimits all documents\n    tokens.extend(enc.encode_ordinary(doc[\"text\"]))\n    tokens_np = np.array(tokens)\n    assert (0 &lt;= tokens_np).all() and (tokens_np &lt; 2**16).all(), \"token dictionary too large for uint16\"\n    tokens_np_uint16 = tokens_np.astype(np.uint16)\n    return tokens_np_uint16\n\n\nI made an analogous script called tinystories.py to load and use the custom Hugging Face tokenizer trained above:\n\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, concatenate_datasets # pip install datasets\n\ntrain_dataset = load_dataset(\"roneneldan/TinyStories\", split=\"train\")\nval_dataset = load_dataset(\"roneneldan/TinyStories\", split=\"validation\")\n\n# download the dataset\nfw = concatenate_datasets([train_dataset, val_dataset])\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nenc = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"tokenizer/tiny_stories_tokenizer\")\n\n# init the tokenizer\neot = enc.encode(enc.eos_token)[0]# end of text token\nMAX_LEN = 512\nprint(f'Using max len of {MAX_LEN}')\ndef tokenize(doc):\n    # tokenizes a single document and returns a numpy array of uint16 tokens\n    tokens = [eot] # the special &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token delimits all documents\n    tokens.extend(enc.encode(doc['text']))\n    #print(f\"tokens: {tokens}\")\n    if len(tokens)&gt;MAX_LEN: return None\n    tokens_np = np.array(tokens)\n    assert (0 &lt;= tokens_np).all() and (tokens_np &lt; 2**16).all(), \"token dictionary too large for uint16\"\n    tokens_np_uint16 = tokens_np.astype(np.uint16)\n    return tokens_np_uint16\n\n\nInside train_gpt2.py, I also loaded this tokenizer, adjusted the GPTConfig class, adjusted the batch size and the sequence length.\nI also commented out all parts pertaining to HellaSwag eval: I’m not interested in training the transformer to do great on HellaSwag as its main purpose is to generate coherent children’s stories.\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass GPTConfig:\n    block_size: int = 512 #1024 # max sequence length\n    vocab_size: int = 6400 # number of tokens: 50,000 BPE merges + 256 bytes tokens + 1 &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token\n    n_layer: int = 12 # number of layers\n    n_head: int = 12 # number of heads\n    n_embd: int = 768 #738 #768 # embedding/hidden dimension\n\n\nenc = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"tokenizer/tiny_stories_tokenizer\") #tiktoken.get_encoding(\"gpt2\")\n\ntotal_batch_size = 524288 # 2**19, ~0.5M, in number of tokens\nB = 64 #32 # micro batch size\nT = 512 #1024 # sequence length\nassert total_batch_size % (B * T * ddp_world_size) == 0, \"make sure total_batch_size is divisible by B * T * ddp_world_size\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI trained for 6200 steps. Validation loss went down consistently from 8.84 at the start to 1.3003 after 6000 steps, then stopped decreasing, increasing slightly to 1.3026 after 6500 steps. As a full pass through the data has already been conducted, it is possible that the model started overfitting slightly to the training data. This suggests that the model with the current settings and size has been fully trained. I expect that perhaps further reducing the model size and training for more epochs could both reduce the potential for overfitting and produce a model of comparable quality in fewer parameters.

Regardless, almost 97% of the stories can be tokenized in their entirety by 512 tokens or less. I thus choose to shrink the sequence length from 1024 to 512: critically, this will reduce the amount of memory taken by the embedding matrices and the activations, allowing me to use much bigger batch sizes per GPU (64 instead of 8 or 10) during training. This leads to further memory speed-ups.\n\nNote that 512 is still a multiple of 32, agreeing with recommendations by both Andrej and Anthony et al (2024).\nAlso, the model would be ~91M parameters rather than 126M parameters of the original GPT-2 small.\nShrinking just the vocab size but not the sequence length increases the training speed from 110K tokens/second with default GPT-2 setup from Part 2 to about 150K tokens/second.\nReducing both the vocab size and the sequence length further speeds up the training to 162K tokens/second, about 47% training speed-up overall.\n\nThe tinystories dataset has 2.12M stories. At about 200 tokens/story at vocab size of 6400, this makes for about 420M tokens. With vocab size shrunk to 6400, I’m able to process batches of size 32 with 1024 tokens/batch per each of the two GPUs, I’m able to process 150K tokens/second, leading to about an 8-hour training run for a full pass through the data.\nIn addition, 96.75% of the stories are under 512 tokens in length. Reducing the sequence length to 512 allows us to increase the batch size to 64 and speeds up training to 162K tokens/second.\n\n\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 train_gpt2.py \n\n\ntorchrun shows the following warning: “Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable for each process to be 1 in default, to avoid your system being overloaded, please further tune the variable for optimal performance in your application as needed.” I have 24 threads on my machine (can find this out with nproc), so setting export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 to let each GPU access 8 threads.\nNow 405M tokens (2.12M stories at 191 tokens/story on average) at 131072 (64 batch size/GPU x 512 sequence length x 2 GPUs) tokens processed/step would take at most 6200 steps for a full epoch."

    "text": "I trained for 6200 steps. Validation loss went down consistently from 8.84 at the start to 1.3003 after 6000 steps, then stopped decreasing, increasing slightly to 1.3026 after 6500 steps. As a full pass through the data has already been conducted, it is possible that the model started overfitting slightly to the training data. This suggests that the model with the current settings and size has been fully trained. I expect that perhaps further reducing the model size and training for more epochs could both reduce the potential for overfitting and produce a model of comparable quality in fewer parameters. In fact, TinyStories research project by Eldan, R., & Li, Y. (2023) suggests this possibility.\nSome sample generations to show the model’s learning progression are below.\n\n\n\nvalidation loss: 2.1717\nrank 1 sample 0: Once upon a time there was a loyal rabbit who left the forest to look for something delicious to eat.

Inside the house was a little girl, all alone. The honest wolf smiled and said \"Hello! Would you like to come in and help me?\".\n\nThe little girl smiled back and said \"Yes, please!\". The wolf then went inside the house to help her. He quickly pulled out a big box from under the table, which he could open to reveal. Inside the box was a special treat for the little girl.

The flowers bloomed for the garden and the grass grew bigger and bigger, until all of the garden was full of colour!\n\nEvery day, the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang as they sang. The garden was a vibrant, peaceful place to be.\n\nBut after a while, something strange happened. Every day, the plants in the garden started to decrease and grow, leavingting the ground completely dry leaves. So, the gardeners decided they had to stop it by taking it back into the forest to try and make it better.\n\nThe gardeners thought and thought, but they had no idea what to do. Then all of a sudden, one of the gardeners had an idea.\n\nâ€œLetâ€™s work together!â€ said the gardener. So the gardeners asked all their friends and family to help out.

It's something very fragile and sweet!\"\n\nLucy was so excited that she couldn't wait to try the jam and she went outside every morning to pick two jars of jam for her breakfast.\n\nThe jam always made Lucy so happy, because when she came home from breakfast, she was able to eat two jars of jam. She was so grateful that she owned two jars of jam, and was the happiest little girl in the world!&lt;|endoftext|&gt;Once there was a dog called Max. He was a very playful pup who loved to explore the world. One day Max went outside and saw a deep stream. He wanted to get to the other side, but it had gotten dark and he was scared.\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a little girl called Alice who lived in a big house. Every day, Alice’s mummy and daddy and her two siblings wanted to explain something very important to Alice.\n\nOne day it was Alice’s birthday, and her mummy and daddy said that she was getting a present! Alice couldn’t believe it, as she had never seen such a present before.\nMummy and Daddy explained that a present is a big, expensive box filled with toys. Alice was excited and couldn’t wait to open it.\nSuddenly, a loud noise came from outside. Daddy and Mummy and Alice ran out of the house and saw a truck full of presents on the street. Everyone in the truck had come out for Alice - it was all because of the expensive box!\nAlice was so excited. She opened the present and carefully chose her very own present, a teddy bear with a big, red bow. She hugged the toy, smiled, and thanked her mummy and daddy and the other men from the truck.\nAlice and her family left the house, excited about the presents. She couldn’t wait to show her friends at preschool the next day!\n\nOnce upon a time in a land far, far away… seems to produce good stories!\nOnce upon a time in a land far, far away there was a little boy named Joe.

As he hopped through the forest, he noticed a big, old, rusty well. He hopped closer and closer until he could see inside.\n\nâ€œWhat do you think is in there?â€ asked the loyal rabbit.\nSuddenly, a small frog poked his head out of the well. â€œI can see a secret of whatâ€™s insideâ€ he said.\nThe rabbit was excited, so he stepped into the well and started to dive. As he dove in, he could hear the stream gurgling and the water running. Suddenly, he heard a voice calling his name.\nâ€œI made it,â€ he said. It was a frog, who lived in the well. â€œCome this way, little one, itâ€™s so much fun here!â€\nThe rabbit thanked the frog and hopped away. Everytime he visits the well, he remembers that loyal and kind heart he made. - Not a bad story but perhaps has tokenization issues? Could consider training for 2000 steps with fully custom tokenizer or understand what’s going on.\n\nLooks like these unusual tokens come directly from the tinystories dataset hosted on Hugging Face. See the following, for example,\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories\n\n\n\nUpon further research, I found that the issue was brought up in the past and is likely a consequence of an encoding issue with UTF-8. Nonetheless, I plan to dig deeper into tokenization to round off this study."
