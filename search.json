    "text": "I’m a data scientist/machine learning engineer experienced with Python, GCP, and LLMs. I love to build with code and LLMs.\n\n\nI hold graduate degress in math and economics,and I’m passionate about machine learning, programming, and LLMs. Currenly, I’m working on number of machine learning projects. From November 2022 to August 2024, I worked as a Data Analyst at LS Direct, where I performed data analytics and data engineering tasks for some of the company’s largest clients, helping the company quintuple the original budgets in some cases. I have developed both internal and client-facing automations using Python, SQL, and GCP, saving our team hours of time weekly. Whenever possible, I deeply favor programmatic solutions that streamline daily processes.\nPreviously, I worked at Lake Mary High School as an AP Computer Science teacher for two years, restarting the school’s AP Computer Science A program (object-oriented and algorithmic programming with Java) and being the founding advisor for LMHS AI Club, introducing advanced students to deep learning with PyTorch and Linux. Prior to that, I taught algebra to disadvantaged communities at Vanden High School.\nBefore that, I’ve completed an undergrad in math and three graduate programs, one in math and yes, two in economics (applied and mathematical), the latest from UC Davis. As a graduate student, I got to work on computer vision applications and to teach statistical methods, econometrics, and graduate economic theory. I have always been drawn to linguistic and computational aspects of the world, and in the past, I’ve learned numerous languages (being reasonably fluent at roughly 7 at one point). Since then I have shifted my passion to deep learning and computer languages, especially LLMs and Python.\nWhen I’m not at work, I’m either working away at LLMs, reading arXiv papers, following along with the fastai community, climbing, or hiking."
