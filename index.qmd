## About me
I’m a data scientist and machine learning engineer with expertise in Python, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and large language models (LLMs). My passion lies in leveraging code and LLMs to build innovative solutions.

Currently, I’m developing several projects focused on language models. From November 2022 to August 2024, I served as a Data Analyst at LS Direct, where I successfully executed data analytics and engineering tasks for major clients, resulting in significant budget increases—up to five times the original amounts. I automated both internal and client-facing processes using Python, SQL, and GCP, saving our team valuable hours each week. I have a strong preference for programmatic solutions that streamline operations and enhance efficiency.

Prior to this role, I taught AP Computer Science at Lake Mary High School for two years, where I rebuilt the AP Computer Science A program and founded the LMHS AI Club, introducing advanced students to deep learning through PyTorch and Linux. Earlier in my career, I taught algebra to underserved communities at Vanden High School.

My academic background includes an undergraduate degree in mathematics and three graduate programs—one in mathematics and two in economics (applied and mathematical), the latest from UC Davis. During my graduate studies, I worked on computer vision applications and taught statistical methods, econometrics, and graduate economic theory. This experience deepened my appreciation for the transformative power of deep learning in computer vision.

I have always been fascinated by the intersection of computation and linguistics, having learned several languages and achieving fluency in around seven at one point. This linguistic curiosity drives my intrinsic interest in LLMs, particularly in creating practical projects that benefit others.

I’m excited to engage with innovative projects and connect with like-minded professionals in the data science and machine learning fields.
