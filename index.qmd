## About me
I’m a machine learning engineer and data scientist with expertise in Python, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and large language models (LLMs). I specialize in building scalable, production-ready ML solutions that enhance automation and decision-making.

Currently, I’m developing and deploying LLM-powered applications. From November 2022 to August 2024, I worked as a Data Analyst at LS Direct, where I led data analytics and engineering efforts for major clients, driving budget increases of up to 5x. I automated internal and client-facing workflows with Python, SQL, and GCP, significantly improving efficiency and reducing manual workload.

Before transitioning into industry, I taught AP Computer Science at Lake Mary High School, where I rebuilt the AP CS A program and founded the LMHS AI Club, mentoring students in deep learning using PyTorch and Linux. Earlier, I taught algebra at Vanden High School, working with underserved communities.

My academic background includes a mathematics degree and three graduate programs—one in mathematics and two in economics (applied and mathematical), the latest from UC Davis. My research included computer vision applications, and I taught statistical methods, econometrics, and graduate economic theory, reinforcing my expertise in ML fundamentals.

Beyond engineering, I have a deep-rooted interest in computation and linguistics, having achieved fluency in around seven languages. This passion fuels my enthusiasm for LLMs, where I focus on building impactful, real-world applications.
