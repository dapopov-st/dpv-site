    "- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` returns documentation in alternative format.\n",
    "- Use `async def` to make the functions non-blocking, enabling other tasks to run concurrently. Useful when function performs I/O-bound operations, such as database queries, file I/O, or network requests, and when need to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.\n",
    "- Type hints will be validated with Pydantic, so if use a non-int in `/items/{item_id}`, will get an error.\n",
    "- Order matters: If `read_user_current` is placed *after* `read_user`, will get an error since FastAPI will read functions top-down and try to validate input to be an integer.\n",
    "- Use `Enums` if path parameter must come from a certain list of values.  If improper parameter is passed, FastAPI will list available values!\n",
    "- To have paths be read correctly, use `:path` path converter, allowing the parameter to capture the entire path, including slashes.\n",
    "- `read_animal` without additional parameters will read off animals 0-10.  With additional parameters, can specify which ones we want via *query parameters*, as in http://127.0.0.1:8000/animals/?skip=0&limit=2.  Here, ? denotes start of query parameters and & separates them.  Can also pass optional parameter as http://127.0.0.1:8000/animals/?skip=0&limit=2&optional_param=3, just make sure to specify it as typing.Optional.\n",

    "Q: What's the difference between WSGI and ASGI gateways as it pertains to Django and FastAPI?\n",
    "WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) and ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) are two different specifications for Python web servers and applications. They serve as interfaces between web servers and web applications or frameworks. Here’s a detailed comparison of WSGI and ASGI, particularly in the context of Django and FastAPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)\n",
    "Synchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "WSGI is designed for synchronous web applications. It handles one request at a time per worker, which can lead to inefficiencies when dealing with I/O-bound operations like database queries or external API calls.\n",
    "Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is traditionally a WSGI-based framework. It works well for most web applications but can struggle with real-time features like WebSockets or long-polling due to its synchronous nature.\n",
    "Common WSGI servers for Django include Gunicorn and uWSGI.\n",
    "Concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "WSGI applications handle concurrency by using multiple worker processes or threads. Each worker handles one request at a time.\n",
    "Deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "WSGI applications are typically deployed using WSGI servers like Gunicorn, uWSGI, or mod_wsgi (for Apache).\n",
    "- ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)\n",
    "Asynchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASGI is designed for asynchronous web applications. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous code, allowing for more efficient handling of I/O-bound operations and real-time features.\n",
    "FastAPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is an ASGI-based framework. It is built from the ground up to support asynchronous programming, making it ideal for applications that require high concurrency, real-time communication, or WebSockets.\n",
    "Common ASGI servers for FastAPI include Uvicorn and Daphne.\n",
    "Concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASGI applications can handle many requests concurrently using asynchronous I/O. This allows for more efficient use of resources, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "Deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASGI applications are typically deployed using ASGI servers like Uvicorn, Daphne, or Hypercorn."
