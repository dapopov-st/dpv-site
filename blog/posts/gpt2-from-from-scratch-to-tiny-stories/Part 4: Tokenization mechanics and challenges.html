<h1>Training a tokenizer</h1>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Part3: Train GPT-2</em>, all the pieces of training GPT-2 from scratch were present <em>except</em> training the tokenizer. For that, I took the GPT-2 tokenizer settings available from Hugging Face and trained a new tokenizer with a smaller vocabulary. In this part, I’ll attempt to train a GPT-2-style tokenizer from scratch following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE">Let’s build the GPT Tokenizer</a>. The custom tokenizer will not match the GPT-2 tokenizer exactly (likely since there are implementation details OpenAI didn’t discuss) and will not be fast enough to use in it’s base Python version. However, the main goal here is to study the mechanics of the tokenization process.</li>
<li>GPT-2 tokenizer uses the UTF-8 unicode encoding standard. In the context of UTF-8, a code point is a unique numerical value assigned to a character, symbol, or glyph in the Unicode character set. UTF-8 encodes ASCII characters in 1 byte, and may use up to 4 bytes for non-ASCII characters as described in the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">Wikipedia article</a>:</li>

<li>Before the text is tokenized, it is converted to UTF-8. This provides many advantages, including
<ul>
<li>Unified representation across languages and scripts</li>
<li>Handling of rare tokens</li>
<li>Better handling of ‘subwords’ for languages where this concept is different than, say, that of standard English</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The main idea of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer is to identify and merge most common pairs, add them to vocabulary, and replace the common pairs with their merged representations. This allows for more compact representations of text, allowing us to fit more information in our limited context window.<br>
</li>
<li>Andrej notes that he would like nothing less than to have models that work directly with Unicode code points, bypassing tokenization completely. This would avoid many of the issues related to tokenization. The main challenge with this approach currently is that the sequences would get too stretched out, allowing smaller effective context.</li>
<li>My version of implementing the merging logic is below:</li>

<li>Andrej notes that every time we merge tokens they become eligible for a merge in the next round.</li>
<li>He also points out that the tokenizer is a completely separate step from the LLM training, it’s main purpose being to convert raw text to sequences of integers. The training step for the tokenizer may be different from the training data, perhaps being a multilingual mixture if we expect the model to be used with different languages in the future and we want compact representations for those languages.</li>

<li>The idea with encoding is to find the pair with the lowest index from the merges dictionary obtained during training. This is because that pair got merged earliest. If there’s nothing to merge (float(’inf) returned),the pair would be the first element of stats and will not be in the merges dictionary. We should then break out of the while loop.</li>

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023\xe2\x80\x932024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\nOne of the world\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income.

Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\nLife and career\nEarly life\n\nSwift\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\xc3\xa9e Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\nSwift\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (n\xc3\xa9e Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\'s songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York\xe2\x80\x93based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\n2004\xe2\x80\x932008: Career beginnings and first album\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\'d come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\'s lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people\'s stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[43]\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks\xe2\x80\x94the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\xe2\x80\x94teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\nFollowing "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should\'ve Said No". All appeared on Billboard\'s Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should\'ve Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\n2008\xe2\x80\x932010: Fearless\nTaylor Swift in 2009\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie.

Swift was 2023\'s most streamed artist on Spotify,[251] Apple Music,[252] and Amazon Music;[253] the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023);[254] and the first living artist to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.[255] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the United States, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[256][257]\nBeyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: "Renegade" and "Birch" by Big Red Machine,[258] a remix of "Gasoline" by Haim,[259] "The Joker and the Queen" by Ed Sheeran,[260] and "The Alcott" by the National.[261] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded "Carolina", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[262] Outside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and has signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[263][264]\n2023\xe2\x80\x93present: The Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department\nSwift singing into a mic\nSwift on the Eras Tour in 2023\nIn March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour\'s cultural and economic impact,[265] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[245] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour\'s ticket sales.[266] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[267][268] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[269][270] Swift\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[271] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a "new stratosphere of global career success" in 2023.[272]\nSwift began dating Kansas City Chiefs\' tight end Travis Kelce in 2023.[273] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[274][275] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, set for release on April 19, 2024.[248][276]\nArtistry\nInfluences\nOne of Swift\'s earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own."[277] Swift said she owes her confidence and "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[278][279]\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift\'s childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks\' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell\'s emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell\'s 1971 album Blue as a favorite "because it explores somebody\'s soul so deeply".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\nGenres\n"If there\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\'s newest raconteur."\n\xe2\x80\x94The Recording Academy, 2021[296]\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a "music chameleon".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave the genre labeling to other people."[309]\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first "documented, official pop album".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, "subdued and amorphous pop sound".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background\xe2\x80\x94a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career "has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing", reaching a point at which "Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift", not defined by any genre.[322]\nVoice\n\n"Cardigan"\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\nSwift uses her lower register in "Cardigan" (2020).[323]\n"Lavender Haze"\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\n"Lavender Haze" (2022) features Swift\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[325] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[326][327] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[328] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[329] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing "intimacy over power and nuance".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\xe2\x80\x94"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was "learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own",[333] swapping her "signature" expressive vocals for "cool, conversational, detached" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&amp;B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her "evocative" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\nReviews of Swift\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as "versatile and expressive".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and "fuller" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\'s voice is "leagues better now".[347] The Guardian highlighted "yo-yoing vocal yelps" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\'s timbre is "breathy and bright" in her upper register and "full and dark" in the lower.[222]\nSongwriting\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor".[360]\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[369] Other themes in Swift\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[358]\nSwift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most "emotionally vulnerable" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You\'re Anything Like Me".[390]\nPerformances\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\n\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled".[403]\nCritics have highlighted Swift\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop\'s most approachable superstar",[416] and the 21st century\'s most popular performer.[417]\nVideo and film\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011[419] and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before.[420] In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn\'t in the scenes."[421]\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\xe2\x80\x94four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift\'s involvement.[422] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[423] Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[424]\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[425] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,[426] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[427] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[245] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[428] Swift has cited Chlo\xc3\xa9 Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[418]\nAccolades and achievements\nFurther information: List of awards and nominations

power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[478] She was one of the "Silence Breakers" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[479] and received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[429] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for "achievement in the arts", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[480][481] In 2014, she was named to Forbes\' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[482] and again in 2017 in its "All-Star Alumni" category.[483] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes\' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[484] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[485] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[245]\nCultural status\nMain articles: Cultural impact of Taylor Swift and Public image of Taylor Swift\n\nSwift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala\nSwift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[486][487] She dominates cultural conversations,[488][489] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist.[490][491][492] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[297] Initially a teen idol,[493] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[312][494] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[495][496] In 2013, New York magazine\'s Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world\'s biggest pop star" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift "falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving her contemporaries "vying for second place".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius".[501]\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as "America\'s Sweetheart" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being "calculated" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and "slut-shaming",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]\nSwift\'s private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift\'s lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]\nLegacy\n"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we\'re at this moment where there\'s no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that\'s on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact."\n\xe2\x80\x93 Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[515]\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[523] Scholars

Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\nOne of the world\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\' World\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\nLife and career\nEarly life\n\nSwift\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\nSwift\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\'s songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\'d come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\'s lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people\'s stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[43]\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\nFollowing "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should\'ve Said No". All appeared on Billboard\'s Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should\'ve Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\n2008–2010: Fearless\nTaylor Swift in 2009\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie. She had a cameo appearance in the film and wrote two songs for its soundtrack.[71][72]\nSwift\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift\'s honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008–2009: "Love Story", "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen", and "Fearless".

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a "bitch".[173][174]\nAfter briefly dating the English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song "Better Man" for the band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single "I Don\'t Wanna Live Forever" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017).

In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[197] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was "far from assured" until Swift intervened.[198]\nA portrait of Swift\nSwift at the American Music Awards of 2019, where she was named Artist of the Decade\nSwift\'s first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released on August 23, 2019.[199] Besides Antonoff, she worked with Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[200] Lover was her sixth consecutive album to sell more than 500,000 US copies in one week.[201] Critics commended the album\'s free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy.[202][203] The singles "Me!" and "You Need to Calm Down" both peaked at number two on the Hot 100,[204] and other singles were the top-10 single "Lover", the top-40 single "The Man",[57] and the 2023 resurgent success, chart topper "Cruel Summer".[205] Lover was the world\'s best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019,[206] and along with its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[207] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, "Me!" won Best Visual Effects, and "You Need to Calm Down" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[208]\nWhile promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[209][210] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[209][211] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[212] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[213][214] Critics panned the film but praised Swift\'s performance.[215] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift\'s life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[216] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[217]\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two "sister albums" that she recorded with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11.[218][219] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[220] Both explore indie folk with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs[221][222] and earned Swift widespread critical acclaim and artistic recognition.[223][224] Each album was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[225] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards[226] and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the US.[227] Swift became the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore\'s "Cardigan".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] According to Billboard, she was 2020\'s highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide.[230]\n2020–2023: Re-recordings and Midnights\n\nSwift performing in 2022\nFollowing the masters dispute, Swift released re-recordings of her first six studio albums, beginning with Fearless (Taylor\'s Version) and Red (Taylor\'s Version) in April and November 2021, respectively.

Media outlets extensively covered the tour\'s cultural and economic impact,[265] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[245] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour\'s ticket sales.[266] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[267][268] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[269][270] Swift\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[271] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a "new stratosphere of global career success" in 2023.[272]\nSwift began dating Kansas City Chiefs\' tight end Travis Kelce in 2023.[273] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[274][275] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, set for release on April 19, 2024.[248][276]\nArtistry\nInfluences\nOne of Swift\'s earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own."[277] Swift said she owes her confidence and "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[278][279]\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift\'s childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks\' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell\'s emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell\'s 1971 album Blue as a favorite "because it explores somebody\'s soul so deeply".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\nGenres\n"If there\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\'s newest raconteur."\n—The Recording Academy, 2021[296]\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a "music chameleon".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave the genre labeling to other people."[309]\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first "documented, official pop album".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, "subdued and amorphous pop sound".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career "has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing", reaching a point at which "Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift", not defined by any genre.[322]\nVoice\n\n"Cardigan"\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\nSwift uses her lower register in "Cardigan" (2020).[323]\n"Lavender Haze"\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\n"Lavender Haze" (2022) features Swift\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[325] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[326][327] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[328] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[329] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing "intimacy over power and nuance".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was "learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own",[333] swapping her "signature" expressive vocals for "cool, conversational, detached" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&amp;B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her "evocative" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\nReviews of Swift\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as "versatile and expressive".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and "fuller" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\'s voice is "leagues better now".[347] The Guardian highlighted "yo-yoing vocal yelps" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\'s timbre is "breathy and bright" in her upper register and "full and dark" in the lower.[222]\nSongwriting\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor".[360]\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[369] Other themes in Swift\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[358]\nSwift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most "emotionally vulnerable" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You\'re Anything Like Me".[390]\nPerformances\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\n\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled".[403]\nCritics have highlighted Swift\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop\'s most approachable superstar",[416] and the 21st century\'s most popular performer.[417]\nVideo and film\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011[419] and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before.[420] In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn\'t in the scenes."[421]\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation.

Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[423] Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[424]\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[425] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,[426] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[427] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[245] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[428] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[418]\nAccolades and achievements\nFurther information: List of awards and nominations received by

<p>we can make the following observations: - By breaking up the text this way, we’ll not be merging ‘e’, for example, as they are now parts of separate elements and we’ll only perform merges within elements.<br>
- GPT-2 pattern instructs the tokenizer not to merge across letters, numbers, punctuation, and select apostrophes. - re.IGNORECASE was not used in the original GPT-2 tokenizer, which means tokenization will not be consistent for uppercase and lowercase words containing apostrophes! - +(?!) is a negative lookahead assertion. It’s matching white spaces up to but not including the last white space. This consistently tokenizes start-of-word tokens with white space prepended to them.</p>
<p>There are additional rules other than chunking and BPE that are not clear from the original OpenAI implementation. For example 4 spaces in a succession would be likely merged by a tokenizer trained on Python code, which was likely the case. However, these spaces are not merged by the default GPT-2 tokenizer:</p>

Can you kneel down and show me how it runs?"\n\nLily knelt down and made the horse run with her hands. Her mother smiled and said, "You\'re so creative, Lily.

 'Once upon a time, there was a mum and her two kids. The two kids were Joe and Sam. Joe and Sam did not always agree with each other. One day, the two boys had a big fight over a toy. Joe wanted to use the toy first, but Sam did not agree.\n\nSo, mum decided to take the boys to see a lawyer. The lawyer was very calm. The lawyer helped them talk with each other and figure out a solution. Eventually, the lawyer helped Joe and Sam agree on which one should use the toy first. \n\nThe boys were proud of themselves for sorting their problem out. Ever since then, they have become very good at using the law when they disagree, and they often keep calm when talking with each other.',
 'One day, a curious little girl named Lucy wanted to have a picnic. She asked her mom, "Can we have a picnic today?" Her mom said, "Yes, but we must be careful." Lucy was very happy and started to pack a big basket with food.\n\nThey went to the park and found a nice spot under a big tree. They put a blanket on the grass and started eating their sandwiches. Lucy saw a little bird and wanted to give it some bread. Her mom said, "Be careful, Lucy. Don\'t go too far."\n\nBut Lucy didn\'t listen. She walked away from the picnic to find the little bird. She looked and looked but couldn\'t find it. She was lost and didn\'t know how to go back to her mom. Lucy started to cry.\n\nHer mom looked for her but couldn\'t find her. She was very sad and scared. The picnic was not fun anymore. They didn\'t know that going too far away from the picnic would make them feel so bad.\n\nIn the end, Lucy and her mom were both very sad. They wished they had listened to each other and stayed close during the picnic.']</code></pre>

<li><p>My tokenizer behaves similarly to Andrej’s, with most merges happening around the same time. Both appear to possess the same compression ratio (tokenized the sample text to 454 tokens to represent text of length 1024) on the chosen sample, and both successfully recover the original sequence. The main difference seems to come from Andrej’s tokenizer using <em>get_stats</em> on each chunk separately and merging pairs within the chunks separately, while mine merges pairs within the entire concatenated byte string. While this is slower (13:57 vs 03:18 on my machine), it is a more careful (and likely more ‘correct’) handling of the individual chunks. I would imagine the modern highly optimized tokenizers to perform tokenization on multiple chunks of text in parallel, aligning best with Andrej’s implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>However, GPT-2 tokenizer appears to yield different tokens even with same vocabulary size. It also differs from the standard BPE tokenizer available from Hugging Face. Since not all details of GPT-2 tokenizer implementation are known (referring to 4-spaces not being merged for Python code, for example), this could be due to a custom implementation detail of GPT-2.</p></li>

<li>It is noteworthy that tokenizer trained directly from GPT-2 tokenizer using the Hugging Face library yielded a smaller compression ratio than the BPE tokenizer (344 vs 314 tokens to represent text of length 1024), and the compression ratio of these tokenizers was larger than that of our custom tokenizers.</li>
<li>Also, both GPT-2 and BPE tokenizer appear to be highly optimized, taking less than a second to train on our sample compared to minutes, implying that it’s the best move to understand the tokenization process and use an optimized off-the-shelf implementation.</li>

<li>GPT-4 tokenizer fixed the case sensitivity pointed out above by making the match pattern case insensitive.</li>
<li>In additional to the encoder and decoder, GPT-2 also has byte_encoder and byte_decoder methods that don’t add substantially to the implementation.<br>
</li>
<li>GPT-2 tokenizer’s vocab size of 50257 comes from 256 raw byte tokens, 50000 merges, and the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token.<br>
</li>
<li>Modern tokenizers, such as the gpt-3.5-turbo tokenizer, also have other special tokens such as &lt;|imstart|&gt;, &lt;|imend|&gt;, etc, where ‘im’ stands for ‘imaginary monologue’ to delimit chat conversations, for example. tiktoken library allows addition of these special tokens.</li>
<li>Adding special tokens necessitates transformer model surgery to add the tokens in the embedding matrix and the classifier layer.</li>

<li>It also tries to split out sentences, which could be challenging since many syntactic units do not squarely fall within sentence/no-sentence category.</li>
<li>By default <em>sentencepiece</em> adds white spaces in front of strings that are not at the start of sentences for consistency of treating words occurring at the start and in the middle of sentences.</li>

<li>With larger vocabulary size, more tokens can be compressed and included within a given context length, but there would also be fewer of a given token for a language model to train on.</li>
<li>While the greater amount of information included within a context window is generally beneficial, too much of it due to a large vocab size is likely not give the model enough time to ‘think’ as it’s attending to the tokens. Thus vocab size can be viewed as a hyperparameter of the model.</li>
<li>If we’re finetuning and want to add special tokens (eg, for using a browser), we would resize the embedding and the weights, then could freeze the original weights and finetune <em>just</em> the new parameters.</li>
<li>There is a gist tokens compression technique where new tokens are introduced and the model is trained by distillation, training just the embedding representations of the new tokens such that the behavior of this language model is identical to that of a model with a very long prompt.

<ul>
<li><p>Andrej’s answers to the following questions are below.</p></li>
<li><p>Why can’t LLM spell words?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Characters are chunked up into tokens, some of which are long (a model with a ‘:DefaultCellStyle’ token will not be able to answer spelling questions about it). Also, if ‘:DefaultCellSty’ is passed to the model, the model generation will likely stop since it has never seen just a chunk of the token in it’s vocabulary and such chunks are outside of the model’s distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why can’t LLM do super simple string processing tasks like reversing a string?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Similarly, reversing a single long token would be challenging to a model unless it’s first prompted to list out the individual characters.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why is LLM worse at non-English languages (e.g.&nbsp;Japanese)?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Tokenizers are not sufficiently trained on non-English data and as a consequence do not compress it sufficiently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why is LLM bad at simple arithmetic?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Addition algorithm is character-level, yet integers are not split up consistently (sometimes into 1, or 2, or 3 digits).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why did GPT-2 have more than necessary trouble coding in Python?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Encoding efficiency of the GPT-2 tokenizer was not great since tabs did not get encoded into single tokens, for example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why did my LLM abruptly halt when it sees the string “&lt;|endoftext|&gt;”?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Something is breaking as this token does not seem to be handled properly: questions to LLMs containing it end up unanswered as this token appears to be parsed when it shouldn’t be when coming from a user that could attack the system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is this weird warning I get about a “trailing whitespace”?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Prompting ending in trailing space sent to instruct models cause sampling inefficiency since tokens at the beginning of words already start with a space and adding an extra space is out of distribution for the model.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why did the LLM break if I ask it about “SolidGoldMagikarp”?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: There’s an internet-famous <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">blog</a> examining clusters of tokens based on their embeddings. When these tokens are used in questions to an LLM that had these tokens in its tokenizer, the model may respond with evasion, hallucination, insults, etc. The likely cause of this is the discrepancy between tokenization and training datasets. In the tokenization dataset, tokens for popular Reddit users such as SolidGoldMagikarp got merged into their own tokens. However, the token likely never appeared in the training data, and the token never got sampled and ‘trained’. Then at test time, giving this token to the model leads to undefined behavior.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why should I prefer to use YAML over JSON with LLMs?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: YAMLs generally end up being tokenized into fewer tokens than JSONs and hence are more economical.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why is LLM not actually end-to-end language modeling?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Tokenization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is the real root of suffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>AK: Andrej really dislikes tokenization ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
