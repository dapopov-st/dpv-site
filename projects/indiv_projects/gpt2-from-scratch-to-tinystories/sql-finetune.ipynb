    "The goal of this project is to build a GPT-2 transformer from scratch in PyTorch, making speed and memory optimizations, training a custom tokenizer (and discussing it's mechanics), further tuning the model parameters to work best for TinyStories training on two 3090s, and finally generating stories from the trained model.\n",

    "- Part 1: Build GPT2.ipynb builds the foundational GPT-2 architecture, mostly following Andrej Karpathy.\n",
    "- Part 2: Optimize GPT-2.ipynb optimizes GPT-2 training process, again following Andrej Karpathy, with adjustments made for dual-3090 setup.\n",
    "- Part 3: Train GPT-2.ipynb trains a custom Hugging Face tokenizer and performs custom training on Tiny Stories dataset roneneldan/TinyStories. Once trained from scratch, GPT-2 is able to generate coherent stories for children.\n",
    "- Part 4: Tokenization mechanics overview.ipynb describes tokenization mechanics and challenges.\n",
